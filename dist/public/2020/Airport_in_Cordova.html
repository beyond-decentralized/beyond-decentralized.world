                            Initial designs behind Airport called for an all-in-browser framework.
                            However after I did enough research this proved to be impractical for the
                            following reasons:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>WebSql is deprecated and may be removed in the future</li>
                            <li>Amount of allowed localStorage is severely limited, even if there
                                is plenty of disk space
                            </li>
                            <li>Registry of servers would have to be centralized or maintained
                                in separate processes
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            While I still had hopes of running Airport in browser (at least in some
                            corner cases), eventually I can to a realization that a separate process
                            would be needed to run the Airport framework. However by then the bulk of
                            the logic has already been written in TypeScript. So the natural choice
                            for running Airport was a Node.js process. But Node.js does not run (at
                            least not well) on mobile platforms and the only other platform I am aware
                            of that runs on mobile and executes Javascript is
                            <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a>. That solved all
                            of the issues listed above and allowed to use other 3rd party frameworks
                            for
                            yet to be implemented features.

                            Here is what a proposed component layout for a typical Airport
                            installation
                            is:

                        <h2>Cordova Side</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Cordova process will contain several internal components:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A component that communicates with other Airport servers (yet to
                                be determined)
                            </li>
                            <li>The core Airport framework running directly in WebView</li>
                            <li>A management client (showing lists of repositories, applications,
                                users, etc.) written in Ionic Framework (to look native)
                            </li>
                            <li>A SqLite process (where all of the data is persisted)</li>
                            <li>A Web server, running on localhost only, used to communicate
                                to local applications
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            For security reasons, it is important to run the Web server that
                            communicates
                            with local applications on localhost only. This is allows for easier
                            verification of actions by client applications. This guarantees that it
                            is the user of the device (or a malicious script running locally) that is
                            requesting access to the Airport database. All that is left to is prompt
                            them
                            with a Captcha and verify that indeed the user is performing the requested
                            action.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Browser Side</h2>
                        <p>
                            On the browser side Airport runs inside an iframe and communicates both
                            with
                            the the localhost that it runs from and with the host application. It does
                            does the communication with postMessage and does all necessary
                            serialization
                            of object graphs before sending them to local web server (and
                            deserialization
                            before passing them back to client application).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application only needs to run a small stub library that passes query
                            query parameters and object graphs (for persistence) to Airport and
                            receive
                            object graphs back.
