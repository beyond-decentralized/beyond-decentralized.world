                        <p>
                            The first (to be) Airport application
                            <a href="https://votecube.com">Votecube</a> was originally written with
                            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore">Firestore</a> as the backend.
                            While it's own central backend will be moved from Firebase to another
                            solution, writing it with that technology exposed me to its
                            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started">Security
                                Rules</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>These rules are in place because by default Firebase is accessed from
                            a client browser. Hence there need to be a special set of rules that
                            had to exist which would validate the newly entered data. After some time
                            I was able to translate some of these concepts into Airport.</p>

                        <p>First of all, basic data format validation (type, size) is already
                            covered by JPA annotations. On top of that all User/Agent information can
                            also be easily verified. Basically if the record is being created then the
                            user information cannot be passed in (it is automatically filled in by
                            Airport). Same goes for creation and update timestamps - these are tracked
                            internally by the modification history (which is mandatory in Airport).
                            And if a record is being referenced then it's easy to always verify that
                            the Id it is referenced by exists in the local database. If it doesn't
                            then
                            how was it referenced from the local client (and used for persistence)
                            in the first place?</p>

                        <p>
                            However one important part was missing from the spec: Given an object
                            graph
                            passed into create/update/save operation which parts of it should be
                            created
                            and or referenced at all?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The perfect way to describe these relations is a JSON tree, not unlike the
                            one used in the entity select statement. Given the following two entities:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code>@Entity()
<b>export class</b> Parent {

    @Id()
    @GeneratedValue()
    key: <b>number</b>;

    value: <b>string</b>;

    @OneToMany({cascade: CascadeType.DELETE, mappedBy: 'parent'})
    children: Child<[];
}

@Entity()
<b>export class</b> Child {

    @Id()
    @GeneratedValue()
    key: <b>number</b>;

    value: <b>string</b>;

    @ManyToOne()
    parent: Parent;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            It is then possible to construct such trees with ease:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><b>export class</b> ParentDao <b>extends</b> BaseParentDao {

    @Persist&lt;ParentGraph&gt;({
        value: Y,
        child: [{
            value: Y
        }, ANOTHER(0, 2)] || null
    })
    <b>static</b> createWithChildren = this.create;
}

<b>export class</b> ChildDao <b>extends</b> BaseChildDao {

    @Persist&lt;ChildGraph&gt;({
        value: Y,
        parent: {
            id: Y
        }
    })
    <b>static</b> createWithParentReference = this.create;
}</code></pre>

                        <p>
                            Note that because the @Persist decorators are processed at build time
                            they:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allow to specify OR conditions and allow for alternative data shapes
                            </li>
                            <li>Allow to specify exactly how many records are expected in an input
                                array
                            </li>
                            <li>Allow to specify a range of how many input records are expected</li>
                            <li>Remove overhead to the client schema library - all information is
                                in package.json and is loaded by Airport framework directly
                            </li>
                            <li>The methods themselves do not need to be specified, only assigned the
                                core operation. They are then assigned an id (based on name) which is
                                used to look up the matching persistence graph.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            With this modification in place the cascade rules for persist operations
                            become obsolete. They are now needed only for delete operations. And for
                            now
                            the only way to perform a delete on an entity is to pass an object (or a
                            stub
                            with its ID) to be deleted. Then the framework will then traverse the
                            cascade rules and delete everything (that is stored locally) accordingly.
                            Of
                            course one can still write a manual delete query with a where clause (that
                            will also delete only the matching local records).
