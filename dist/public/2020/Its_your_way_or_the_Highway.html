                            Quite a bit of code written as part of the Airport effort really has
                            little to do with the concept of Autonomous Interdependent Repositories
                            (AIR).
                            <br>
                            Here is a list core, already working features that are needed for
                            Airport to function but are not strictly part of it:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Entity Decorators</li>
                            <li>Query Language</li>
                            <li>DDL generation</li>
                            <li>Query object generation</li>
                            <li>Dependency Injection Framework</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In fact these can be used completely independently of Airport. So, I will
                            soon be open-sourcing these features as their own project - Highway.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Highway design goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            The idea of the Highway project has been floating around my head for a
                            while. Originally it was envisioned to be the traditional ("serverful")
                            addon to Airport. It spawned from the realization that very few
                            businesses using Airport would not have any centralized infrastructure.
                            Most of them would probably have part of the data shared "globally",
                            meaning the data is accessible to everyone. Hence a way to unite the
                            purely group/personal oriented Airport data and globally accessible data
                            behind a single front-end SDK.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Very recently I came to a realization that Highway isn't just an addon
                            to Airport. In fact is more of the opposite. Highway can stand alone
                            as a project of its own (providing a way to work with traditional
                            client/server data) where as Airport is an addon to that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With that in mind, here are the design goals behind highway:
                        </p>
                        <h3>Provide a better/more productive UI development experience</h3>
                        <p>
                            Current Javascript/Typescript ORMs fall short of what I would consider
                            the "holy/grail" of ORMs. There is of course
                            <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> but it does not tie itself to
                            a relational database as a backing engine and requires writing and
                            maintaining server-side code. Highway aims to provide a development
                            experience that is inspired by GraphQL but is deeply rooted in the
                            relational data model.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Provide a seamless integration with scalable technologies</h3>
                        <p>
                            A website backed by a relational database has severe performance
                            limitations. Any significant usage spikes can lead to degraded site
                            performance or even an outage. This can be traced to the need for querying
                            a multitude of objects to come up with queryable views. Relational data
                            model just doesn't scale as well as document oriented alternatives (or
                            if it <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">does</a> it's costs are
                            much higher then they would be with a more performance oriented
                            <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">option</a>). Highway aims to unify
                            the NoSQL and relational worlds with a simple decorator. Given 2
                            entities:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
@Entity()
<b>export class</b> Parent {

    @Id()
    @GeneratedValue()
    key: <b>number</b>;

    value: <b>string</b>;

    @OneToMany({cascade: CascadeType.DELETE, mappedBy: 'parent'})
    children: Child<[];
}

@Entity()
<b>export class</b> Child {

    @Id()
    @GeneratedValue()
    key: <b>number</b>;

    value: <b>string</b>;

    @ManyToOne()
    parent: Parent;
}
                    </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The query originally defined
                            <a href="https://dataindependence.net/blog/2020/Build_time_Queries.html">here</a>
                            can be simply amended with an <b>@View()</b> decorator:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
<b>export class</b> ParentDao <b>extends</b> BaseParentDao {
    @View()
    @Query&lt;IQParent&gt;(select({
            id: Y,
            value: Y,
            children: {
                id: Y,
                value: Y
            }
        }).from(p => ({
            p,
            c: p.children.innerJoin()
        }).where((parentId, notLikeChildValue, q) =>
            q.p.id == parentId
            && !q.c.value.like(notLikeChildValue)
        }).orderBy(q => [
            q.p.id.desc(),
            q.c.id.desc()
        ]))
    <b>static</b> selectWithChildren: (
           parentId: number,
           notLikeChildValue: string
       ) => Promise&lt;Parent[]&gt;;
}
                    </code></pre>
                        <p>This decorator informs Highway that this query is actually served by a
                            NoSQL view. Highway can then take care of all the required details of
                            maintaining a relational database and a NoSQL front-facing store in
                            sync.</p>
                        <h3>Provide a seamless integration with FTS technologies</h3>
                        Quite a bit of the traffic going to modern sites deals with Full Text Search
                        queries. While relational databases
                        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22223629">can</a> and
                        <a
                            href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/full-text-search-is-now-available-for-preview-in-azure-sql-database/">do</a>
                        support full text search they by their nature won't be as efficient as
                        <a href="https://vespa.ai/">specialized</a> solutions. Highway aims to
                        hide the complexity of dealing with full text search implementations from
                        the developer behind a simple <b>@Search</b>decorator:
                        <code>
                        <pre>
@Entity()
<b>export class</b> Parent {

    @Id()
    @GeneratedValue()
    key: <b>number</b>;

    @Search()
    value: <b>string</b>;

    @OneToMany({cascade: CascadeType.DELETE, mappedBy: 'parent'})
    children: Child<[];
}
                        </pre>
                    </code>
                        <p>
                            Entities can then be searched for using a set of query related concepts:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code>
<b>export class</b> ParentDao <b>extends</b> BaseParentDao {
    @Search()
    <b>static</b> searchIdsOnly: (
           searchString: string
       ) => Promise&lt;number[]&gt;;

    @Search()
    <b>static</b> searchWholeEntities: (
           searchString: string
       ) => Promise&lt;Parent[]&gt;;

    @Search()
    @Query&lt;IQParent&gt;(select({
            id: Y,
            value: Y,
            children: {
                id: Y,
                value: Y
            }
        }))
    <b>static</b> searchWithChildren: (
           searchString: string
       ) => Promise&lt;Parent[]&gt;;
}
                    </code></pre>
                        <p>Highway aims to hide the complexity of integrating a full text search
                            engine (if any) with a relational database or a NoSQL view provider</p>

                        <h3>Provide a seamless integration with auto-scalable technologies</h3>

                        <p>Very few sites start out large-scale. Quite often you have no idea how
                            big the concept behind the site will be and how much performance
                            optimization
                            will be required to keep it running. Highway aims to integrate
                            cloud-native
                            tech like autoscaling <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/">NoSQL</a>
                            and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/">Full Text Search</a> (as
                            well as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/">other</a>

                            solution)
                            with you only specifying a simple flag of how you want the solution to be
                            deployed. Once your site hits those high traffic marks Highway aims to
                            make your transition to more cost effective solutions as easy as switching
                            a value of that same simple flag.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Support as many implementations as possible</h3>
                        <p>By default Highway will support the AWS stack to back its scalability
                            options. The intent is to support as many solutions as is practical.</p>
