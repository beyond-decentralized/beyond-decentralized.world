                    <div class="entry__content">
                        <p>Since the beginning of the Airport project the question of how to share
                            data was outstanding. &nbsp;Eventually I started the
                            automated-gateway-transit library to act as a gateway between airport
                            instances. &nbsp;However overtime I came to a realization of how much
                            work it would be to come up with a fully custom peer-to-peer solution.
                            &nbsp;So, I began looking at alternatives. &nbsp;I started with <a
                                href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a> since it had was fully
                            distributed with automatically promoting nodes based on their
                            connectivity and bandwidth to being gateway nodes.</p>
                        <h2>Peergos</h2>
                        <p>However I quickly changed my choice to <a href="https://peergos.org/">Peergos</a>
                            once I've learned about it. &nbsp;First of all, it is based on <a
                                href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, which is already on the way
                            of being <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-10-08-ipfs-browsers-update/">integrated
                                with browsers</a>.</p>
                        <p>Peergos secures file sharing over IPFS and also specifies how user
                            accounts are created. &nbsp;And it turns out to be a really good
                            platform for Airport since every repository can be described as a
                            directory and all transactions in that repository can be described as
                            files.</p>
                        <p>Here is what my first go at a Repository sharing layout looks like:</p>
                        <img src="images/Air_Tower_-_data_flow.png" alt="Air Tower - basic data flow">
                        <p>Given that two devices share a given Repository:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each of the devices acts as a Peergos server</li>
                            <li>On both devices the Repository transactions are stored in a
                                directory
                            </li>
                            <li>Each devices only stores the transactions it generates</li>
                            <li>Devices maintain a write log and push it to the other device (it
                                can just be the id of the last transaction)
                            </li>
                            <li>Once a device notices that there are remote changes it connects to
                                the other device and loads the new transactions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This setup requires all devices to be aware of all other devices where
                            the repository exists and for devices to be able to connect to each
                            other directly. &nbsp;Alternative (though more complicated) setups are
                            possible that won't require all devices to connect to each other and
                            check write logs via proxies.</p>
                        <p>Also it is possible for a user to only maintain one Peergos server (for
                            instance on a desktop) and have all the rest of their devices (cell
                            phone &amp; tablet) connect to it to retrieve and store updates.</p>
                        <p>But to begin with I'm going with the simplest possible solution and
                            we'll see what alternative setups will be necessary.</p>
                        <p>There is one concern with using Peergos that I have right now - it is
                            written in Java 11+. Java will run on Android, but to the best of my
                            understanding maximum supported version is
                            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53456107/does-android-support-java-11">Java
                                8</a>.
                            Currently I'm planning on getting around this by using
                            <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/">Native
                                Image</a>
                            technology in <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. I'm yet to
                            test in out but so far it appears to be low risk since it uses a standard
                            C++ compilation toolchain.
                        </p>
                        <p>Using native images should also sovle the problem of running Peergos
                            on iOS as well. Looking forward, the ideal setup for Airport is to run
                            entirely in browser and not require any local application installations.
                            Accomplishing that appears to be possible with with
                            <a href="https://www.leaningtech.com/pages/cheerpj.html">Cheerpj</a> which
                            compiles Java to a combination of WASM and JavaScript.
