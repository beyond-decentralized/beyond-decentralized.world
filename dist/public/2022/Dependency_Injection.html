                            A key factor in Turbase (and thus AIRport) adoption will be the ease of
                            writing applications. One key feature that needs to be done in a
                            developer friendly way is Dependency Injection.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Current Implementation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Internal AIRport dependency injection is done "on the stack", with tokens.
                            First there is a library level tokens.ts file that defines dependency
                            injection tokens for a library:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><b>import</b> {domain} <b>from</b> '@airport/di'
<b>import</b> {IMyClass} <b>from</b> './MyClass'
<b>import</b> {IMyOtherClass} <b>from</b> './MyOtherClass'

<b>const</b> airport = domain('air')
<b>const</b> myLibrary = airport.lib('myLibrary')

<b>const</b> MY_CLASS = myLibrary.token&lt;IMyClass&gt;('MY_CLASS')
<b>const</b> MY_OTHER_CLASS = myLibrary.token&lt;IMyOtherClass&gt;('MY_OTHER_CLASS')</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Each injectable class is defined in its own file (with it's interface)
                            sometimes being defined in the same file.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><b>import</b> { container, DI} <b>from</b> '@airport/di'
<b>import</b> { MY_CLASS, MY_OTHER_CLASS } <b>from</b> './tokens'

<b>export interface</b> IMyClass {

    myMethod(): Promise&lt;void&gt;

}

<b>export class</b> MyClass <b>implements</b> IMyClass {

    myMethod(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
        const myOtherClass = await container(this).get(MY_OTHER_CLASS)

        await myOtherClass.myOtherMethod()
    }

}
DI.set(MY_CLASS, MyClass)</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            This gives AIRport the ability to upgrade the framework and applications
                            without having to reload them. AIRport may be running on a device for
                            a long period of time. During that time patches may be made to AIRport.
                            Critical patches will have be installed on the device AIRport runs on.
                            Requiring a full reload of the framework or the running applications
                            will necessarily consume battery power on the device and may be percieved
                            as being very intrusive and inconvenient. With "on the stack" injection
                            a patch with changed classes may be downloaded on to the devices and then
                            executed via an additional script tag. That patch will simply re-register
                            the changed classes with the dependency injection library. The DI library
                            will then flip the switch to the new classes at the most opportune time (
                            whenever there are no active transactions running on the system).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Token based injection allows to accomplish that with relative ease while
                            still allowing for typesafety (with each token specifying the interface
                            of the class it retrieves).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Making it developer friendly</h2>
                        <p>
                            However it is not fair to make an average developer learn this specialized
                            dependency injection system - even more things to learn and remember on top
                            of learning a new framework. Thus, I've come up with a wrapper for this
                            system, which makes dependency injection seamless.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Property injection</h3>
                        <p>
                            In AIRport token based injection is done on the stack. That is
                            dependencies get loaded only when they are accessed. The main benefit
                            of this approach is that it allows to replace a part of @Injectable()s
                            without having to replace the objects they dependend on. It also
                            minimizes the risk of circular dependency lock between injected objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Access to injected objects can be done via object properties and
                            also done on the stack, at the same time. This is because a property
                            can be hidden behind a "get propertyName()" call. The new
                            dependency injection wrapper works by automatically converting object
                            properties which are annotated with @Inject() decorator. Here is what
                            the above example looks like in the wrapped version:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code><b>import</b> { Inject } <b>from</b> '@airport/di'
<b>import</b> { IMyOtherClass } <b>from</b> './MyOtherClass'

<b>export interface</b> IMyClass {

    myMethod(): Promise&lt;void&gt;

}

@Injectable()
<b>class</b> MyClass <b>implements</b> IMyClass {

    @Inject()
    myOtherClass: IMyOtherClass

    myMethod(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
        await myOtherClass.myOtherMethod()
    }

}</code></pre>
                        <h2>How it works</h2>
                        <p>
                            @Injectable() decorator is now used to distinguish injectable classes from
                            other classes. @Api() classes are automatically injectable. @Inject()
                            decorator is used to distinguish injected properties from other ones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every AIRport application is already pre-processed to generate Query and Object
                            interfaces from the DLL objects. This same process will now examine all of
                            non-DDL and non-generated sources and create injection descriptors from them:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code><b>import</b> {domain} <b>from</b> '@airport/di'
<b>import</b> {IMyClass, MyClass} <b>from</b> './MyClass'
<b>import</b> {IMyOtherClass, MyOtherClass} <b>from</b> './MyOtherClass'

<b>const</b> airport = domain('air')
<b>const</b> myLibrary = airport.lib('myLibrary')

<b>const</b> MY_CLASS = myLibrary.token&lt;IMyClass&gt;({
    class: MyClass,
    interface: 'IMyClass',
    token: 'MY_CLASS'
})
<b>const</b> MY_OTHER_CLASS = myLibrary.token&lt;IMyOtherClass&gt;({
    class: MyOtherClass,
    interface: 'IMyOtherClass',
    token: 'MY_OTHER_CLASS'
})

MY_CLASS.setDependencies({
    myOtherClass: MY_OTHER_CLASS
})</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            tokens.ts will now become generated by the system. All class interfaces
                            for @Inject()ed classes will also be generated (and won't have to
                            be created manually).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The token's descriptors will now keep track of it's dependencies.These will
                            now be added to a JSON descriptor for that token (in tokens.ts). That
                            file will also allow the AIRport preprocessor to process dependencies from
                            other projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When an object of a particular class is first retrieved by the dependency
                            injection system, all of the properities defined in the 'setDepenencies'
                            descriptor are replaced with getters that syncronously retrieve the needed
                            dependency. A separate method (get${PROPERTY_NAME}Async) is also provided
                            to retireve the dependency asyncronously, in case its retrieval needs to
                            block while other resources load. When that objects, getter/async method
                            is called, the class is retrieved from the descriptor and instantiated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a class has asyncronous initialization logic an "async initialize()"
                            method must be defined in that class. It is called only once per Class
                            (see below for @Injectable() object pools). If it has not been called
                            yet and a syncronous getter is used the retrieve an object of that class,
                            a runtime error is thrown.
                        </p>

                            Transaction tracking
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm currently working on tracking transactions across applications and
                            another benefit that getter based dependency injection system brings is
                            ability to track transactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As described <a href="./Application_Interoperability.html">previously</a>
                            transactions can run across multiple appilcations. This means that
                            (at least in environments that support multiple parallel transactions)
                            for any given application, multiple transactions can be in-flight at
                            any given point in time. This means that an application must be able
                            to pass the correct Transaction Id for every DAO.save call it performs.
                            This in turn means that there must be tracking of what DAO calls are
                            made from which @Api() invocation.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why this Really matters</h3>
                        <p>
                            Support for multiple concurrent transactions is critical to AIRport
                            adoption. AIRport is meant to be run both on the client (for private
                            data) and on the server (for shared data), with seamless integration.
                            You write the code once and it automatically both works on SqLite
                            in wasm and on CockroachDb with geographical sharding, while putting
                            the read load on ScyllaDb and Vespa (or any other stack with
                            additional adapters). Ability to do this will allow for hybrid
                            applications to quickly be written, and existing centralized
                            applications will be able to to plugin and offer decentralization
                            where it matters - for family and group user conversations and
                            planning.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Injectable object pool</h3>
                        <p>
                            This can be accomplished by assigning a dedicated object (on an
                            @Injectable() class) to a given @Api() call thread. Every time a getter is invoked to
                            retrieve an @Injectable() object that object is requested in the pool
                            of objects of it's type, if there is a free one. If there isn't, a new
                            one is created and returned.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The reason for creation of new instances of @Injectable() classes is to
                            store "thread local" information in them. The only other way to do it
                            in client-side/browser JavaScript environment is
                            to pass it though as an input parameter for all of the methods
                            between the initial @Api() call and the internal DAO modification methods.
                            Doing so is very strait forward and explains to the developers what is
                            going on "under the hood" but places un-due burden of wiring in a context
                            property that the developer has no need for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having given it some thought I'm planning on keeping this manual
                            option of passing Transaction ID in as an input parameter. This
                            option will documented an available for developers to use, if they choose
                            to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, for the bulk of the developers I'm expecting the "it magically works"
                            method to be more useful (at least after they understand how it actually works).

                        <p>
                            In the convenient method of doing things, every @Injectable() object in the
                            injection chain is created (or re-used from it's unused pool of objets)
                            specifically for the purpose of serving that particular @Api() request. This
                            means that all of the state stored in these objects is scoped to that @Api()
                            request and effectively acts as a "Thread Local" scope. It is on that scope that
                            the Transaction ID associated with the @Api() call is stored. Once a database
                            operation call is finally passed into the framework (to the framework adapter that
                            is running in the App VM/Iframe) the framework accesses this state in the
                            base DAO object (that is extended by the App's DAO objects).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Additional uses of Request scoped @Injectables()</h3>
                        <p>
                            Currently all @Injectable() classes must be stateless. This is because they might
                            be swapped out for a newer version when a bug-fix patch is processed (again, as
                            explained previously, reloading a couple of dozen iframes and loading all of their
                            source as well as the source of the framework in the main frame could drain the
                            device battery and can hinder AIRport adoption).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having Request scoped @Injectables() solves this issue. Since AIRport Apps are
                            already preprocessed all member state can be automatically put into a central store
                            while providing instance variables as an API (via getters). Also, @Request() and
                            @Session() scoped beans can be implemented on top of this.
