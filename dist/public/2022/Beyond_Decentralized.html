                        <p>
                            In 2015 I wrote a Family Organizer and realized that families
                            would have to trust a company with their plans. I started to write
                            <a
                                href="https://autonomousinterdependentrepositories.wordpress.com/2016/04/23/first-blog-post/">
                                a relational adapter</a> for Google Docs to store data in
                            personal accounts. Overtime it evolved into
                            <a href="https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRport">
                                AIRport </a>. I have been thinking that AIRport can also
                            work in centralized environments and seamlessly serve both
                            centralized and decentralized data. Now I'm realizing how siloed,
                            centralized databases can join a fine-grained, privacy oriented
                            network of databases.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Decentralized</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the decentralized environment AIRport runs on user devices.
                            Apps are loaded in VMs and inter-operate through AIRport. Data
                            never goes out to third-party servers and stays in a database
                            on user's device. Repositories are maintained in
                            <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IFPS</a> and
                            <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>. This works well
                            for family and friends data but does not work for situations where
                            data is shared with the general public. AIRport Applications can
                            with the data from central servers but that data would still be
                            siloed.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Organizational</h2>
                        <p>
                            Luckily, I had to learn OAuth recently. This made me realize that
                            there already is an authorization infrastructure for internet-scale
                            interoperation. Apps are already talking to APIs everywhere, they
                            just aren't sharing a common database. This is what the
                            <a href="https://dataindependence.net/">
                                Data Independence Network</a> tries to answer - how to keep data
                            locally and allow to share it globally, in a secure and fair
                            way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The industry already has a technical solution for a global database.
                            Relational databases like CockroachDB already let
                            you partition relational tables and schemas geographically
                            or in just about any other way. But this means
                            that everyone has to be on the same distributed database. Singing
                            up everyone for (and placing everything in) the same database is not
                            likely to work. What is needed is an internet of databases. There has
                            to be a way to share just the right amount of data to fulfill the needs
                            of the calling App for a particular User.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is where AIRport excels - each Repository is meant to have all of
                            the information needed to fulfill functions associated with that data
                            and also can automatically be linked with more related data, if and
                            when needed. Because each Repository hop is a distinct operation,
                            AIRport answers the who, what, when, where, why and how questions
                            on data sharing.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Permissions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Of course enforcing rules on per-repository basis is
                            hard to accomplish manually. The technical side of doing
                            so is easily accomplished by OAuth but figuring out if
                            a given App+User should have a permsission to a given
                            repository is not a trivial task. It is possible to come
                            with and maintain a database of permissions (and in some
                            cases it will be the way to go) but for (likely) the vast
                            majority of the cases large scale data modeling,
                            per-repository pre-flight text processing and artificial
                            intelligence will be required.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Adapting Repositories</h3>
                        <p>
                            Another question is how to take an existing centralized
                            relational database and break it up into pieces. After
                            adding REPOSITORY_ID and REPOSITORY_ACTOR_ID columns
                            something will have to figure out what data belongs to
                            which repository. Here, for fast majority of the cases
                            following the @OneToMany and @ManyToOne links in the
                            data will allow you to isolate data groupings eligible
                            for being Repositories. If there are logical rules for
                            spitting the data, filters can be written that will
                            narrow the boundaries of Repositories as they are first
                            being retrieved and defined. And for very large databases,
                            models can be trained on data samples and then deployed
                            to govern Repository boundaries for all of the data.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Or just plugging in</h3>
                        <p>
                            In certain cases it may not be required to split up
                            relational databases at all. This can be done when
                            AIRport is running in an environment protected by the
                            organization that is sharing its data. With additional
                            AIRport hooks that Organization can write apps that
                            will provide security rules for all queries performed
                            against it's data. This will allow other third-party
                            Applications to Run on the same server and to join
                            Repositories from other databases to still-centralized
                            data of this Organization. The core requirement for
                            interoperability at this level is publishing of the
                            Organization's schema definition for others to see
                            and build queries against.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately the sharing granularity provided by Repositories,
                            combined with ability to separate Data providers from
                            Application providers gives the ability for Applications
                            to share data across companies and jurisdictions without
                            compromising privacy of those companies and jurisdictions.
                            This is accomplished because AIRport controls all database
                            access and API operation flow, and acts as a temporary
                            custodian for the data. Applications just run in locked down
                            VMs and can't send or receive data from anything other than
                            AIRport server. AIRport controls all interoperation with other
                            local Applications and other AIRport servers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a bit more work AIRport will share data across multiple
                            databases, schemas, devices, applications and users. It is
                            designed to so in end-users best interests - in the
                            interestests of the every day families and friends. There is
                            a lot of work ahead to bring it to the public and much more
                            work to get it adopted. After the first AIRport applications
                            are deployed and first central databases are based on it, to
                            take it to the internet level the next big question will be
                            - how to ensure that AIRport servers can be trusted by all
                            parties involved.
