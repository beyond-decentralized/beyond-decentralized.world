                        <p>
                            As I'm using AIRport APIs I'm realizing that the
                            existing records passed into AIRport APIs need to be
                            verified as such. This is leading me to finalize the
                            Id API for AIRport.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Duality of Ids
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Id validation is usually taken care of automatically.
                            If you are doing an update operation and the key for
                            the updated or referenced entity is not found, the
                            update operation will fail in the database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AIRport stores all records in memory (in Web version and
                            in app server caches). To <a href="AIR_UuId.html#performance">save
                                on the RAM</a>
                            (required to store tables and indexes) AIRport uses local
                            numeric Ids (or just local ids) to identify all of the
                            objects within the local database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For AIRport Clients and Apps each object contains a
                            computed <a href="./AIR_UuId.html">GUID field</a>
                            (previously described as "uuId"). The
                            Client is expected to use GUIDs and ignore
                            local Ids.  This will cause to bugs if inexperienced
                            developers use local Ids. This is a likely scenario
                            since currently local ids are named "id".
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Renaming Ids
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            To reduce developer confusion the "id" field is now
                            renamed to "_localId".  This accurately
                            describes the purpose of this field - it is there to
                            link records together in the local database (often
                            in memory).  The name also doesn't immediately stand
                            out as something to be used as an identifier. The
                            "actorRecordId" is also numeric but is unique for
                            an actor within a repository and hence is globally
                            unique. It is now renamed to "_actorRecordId" to signify
                            its "internal usage" nature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make things clear the GUID  field is now renamed to
                            be "id". It is globally unique for all Entity
                            records and naming it "id" clearly indicates to the user
                            that it is what should be used as the identifier.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Checking Entity Existence
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The renaming "GUID" to just "id" also clarifies record
                            existence checks. AIRport will automatically perform this
                            functionality (just like raw relational databases), at the
                            cost of making additional queries:
                        </p>
                        <h3>On save - TODO</h3>
                        <p>
                            AIRport will create an in-memory cache
                            for the top level transaction (also used by all nested
                            transactions). All objects passed into "save" operations
                            (including nested objects) will be added to this
                            cache. At the time of "save" operation, AIRport will scan
                            the passed in object graph and mark all objects not yet proven
                            to already exist. It then will query for those objects by
                            GUIDs and update numeric ids in the passed in object graph
                            (with what is present in the local database). If there are
                            non-existing objects the "save" operation will throw an
                            Error.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an additional bonus, this will verify that all referenced
                            repositories (that are pulled in) are
                            <a href="https://beyond-decentralized.world/2022/Cross-Repository_operations.html">
                                loaded into the local database</a>.

                        </p>
                        <h3>On query - done (updated 7/4/2022)</h3>
                        <p>
                            All entity query operations now find all
                            all of the Repositories and Actors (along with Users and their
                            locations, since that is likely to be used in UIs) present in
                            the passed-in object graph. That's just two distinct queries (
                            regardless of the side of the object graph) and won't have
                            a significat impact on AIRport performance.
