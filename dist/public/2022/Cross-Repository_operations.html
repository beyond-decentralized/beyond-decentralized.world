                            all of the records necessary for work on a particular unit, such as
                            a UI page while storing everything in a relational database via a

                            when a record gets added to a Repository it brings along with it all of the
                            records it points to via @ManyToOne() relationships. However it still retains
                            information about the original record that it was pointing to. This is done
                            for every AIR Entity with the "original" fields:

                            Basic operations
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The core concept of AIRport is that by default database operations
                            do not cross Repository boundaries. This means
                            that all relational queries will use the
                            "repository"/"actor"/"actorRecordId" fields for joining records
                            across database tables.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It also means that "save" method of
                            <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-access-object-pattern/">DAO</a>
                            objects will modify only the Repository of the passed-in top level records.
                            This works for the majority of use cases but sometimes you
                            need to query across Repositories and make modifications across them.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Working across Repositories
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The solution to this is to introduce the @CrossRepository() decorator
                            to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19154202/data-access-object-dao-in-java">
                                Dao methods</a>. All database operations in Dao methods decorated
                            with @CrossRepository() will work across repositories.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><b>class</b> MyDao {

    @CrossRepository()
    <b>async</b> myCrossRepositoryMethod(
        myRecordUuIds: <b>string</b>[],
        myRecords: MyRe<b></b>cord[]
    ) {
        // This find queries across repositories
        let myRec: QMyRecord,
            othRec: QOtherRecord
            <b>this</b>._find({
            select: {
                '*': Y,
                otherRecords: {}
            },
            from: [
                myRec = Q.MyRecord,
                othRec = mr.otherRecords.leftJoin()
            ],
            where: myRec.in(myRecordUuIds)
        })

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a non cross-repository method is invoked within a cross-repository
                            one it will still respect the repository boundaries for all of
                            the queries executed within it. Same mechanism works for
                            cross-repository methods being called from non cross-repository ones,
                            in an inverse way.
                        </p>

                            Query details
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Cross-repository queries are actually pretty easy. When joining
                            records across Repositories the "original"
                            repository/actor/actorRecordId foreign key fields are used. For
                            records originating in this Repository "original" fields contain
                            the same values as regular repository/actor/actorRecordId
                            foreign key fields. So, the query works in the same way as non
                            cross-repository equivalent, unless the records (referenced by
                            the foreign key fields) are copied from another repository,
                            <a href="http://localhost:8080/blog/2021/Follow_the_Many_to_Ones.html">
                                as required in AIRport</a>. Thus, joining by "original" fields
                            will return the original records, not their copies within this
                            repository (if they were copied).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h3> Peristence details.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Persistence operations are also pretty easy. Normally AIRport will
                            ignore nested entities that do not belong to the same repository
                            as the parent record. In cross-repository methods AIRport will
                            perform the save across all repositories present in the graph.
                            Because non-"original" foreign keys of persistend records
                            always point to the current repository, following rules apply
                            all nested records that do not belong to the current repository:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Record Creation: records will
                                be created in both the the referenced repository and in the
                                repository of the parent record (as copies).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Record Updates: records will be updated in the referenced
                                repository and a copy of the record will be created in
                                the repository of the parent record (replacing the currently
                                pointed to record, which will be deleted, along will all
                                record copies it has foreign keys to).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Record Deletes: by definition existing nested records are
                                in the current repository. If the deleted record's
                                "original" foreign keys point to another repository, the
                                pointed-to record in the other repository will be deleted
                                as well.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Use with care</h2>
                        <p>
                            Cross-repository queries work just fine in centralized databases but
                            are tricky in decentralized environments. This is because the
                            referenced repository may not be present on the local device. Thus,
                            for cross-repository queries AIRport will inspect the result set
                            before returing it. If there are missing nested records (from
                            repositories that are not present in the local database) it will
                            fetch the missing repositories from the network (and subsequently
                            re-run the query before its' result is returned). Same goes for
                            cross-repository persistence operations - missing referenced
                            repositories will be loaded from the network. Naturally, this can
                            lead to poor database performance.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Enabling back-end optimizations</h2>


                        Eventually Cross-Repository queries will give a hint to the AIRport
                        app servers in back-end environments. Cross-Repository operations
                        will go against the backing relational database while normal
                        operations will be performed in-memory against a locally cached
                        repository, which is either already in the local in-memory database,
                        or is
                        <a href="https://dataindependence.net/blog/2022/Solving_Id_Problems.html#performance">
                            pulled into memory</a> from a <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">
                            wide colum database</a> which is an order of magnitude faster
                        than the backing relational database.

                        <h2>Interdependence is here</h2>
                        <p>
                            Cross-Repository operations complete the core AIRport spec
                            by making Repositories interdependent: "AIR" in AIRport stands
                            for "Autonomous Interdependent Repositories". When a Dao
                            method is decorated with @CrossRepository() all of its
                            database operations automatically load all Repositories
