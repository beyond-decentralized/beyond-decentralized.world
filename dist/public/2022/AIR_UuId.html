                            Working with raw AIRport ids is cumbersome. The reason for that is the fact
                            that an Id of an entity is spread across 3 different entities:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>MyEntity {
    actor: {
        // backed by a foreign key column in MyEntity
        id: 123
    },
    actorRecordId: 456,
    repository: {
        // backed by a foreign key column in MyEntity
        id: 789
    }
}</code></pre>

                        <h2>UUIDs</h2>
                        <p>
                            Moreover the ids are local to the AIR database and can differ between AIRport
                            databases. Globally the records are identified by UuIds for Repository
                            and Actor (in combination with actorRecordId). To get uuIds you have to join
                            to the Actor and Repository tables:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>MyEntity {
    actor: {
        // Exists only in 
        uuId: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
    },
    actorRecordId: 456,
    repository: {
        uuId: 'IPFS-QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLj9Zm1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF'
    },
}</code></pre>

                        <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
                        <p>
                            AIRport UUIDs are strings that are at least 90 characters long (and will
                            probably average 92 characters in most cases):
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>IPFS-QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLj9Zm1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000-123</code></pre>
                        <p>

                            Reason for pulling out UuIds out of records is space savings. There
                            are 4 UuIds to store - Actor UuId, Repository UuId, Original Actor UuId
                            and Original Repository UuId (with originals neccessarily populated for
                            cross-repository queries). This adds up to 368 bytes per record. On top of
                            that you have to add space for indexes for each one of these. With that it
                            can come close 1K per record or more, depending on number of foreign keys
                            and indexes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Modern phones have plenty of storage space (latest IPhone models at the time
                            of writing of this blog post come with at least 128GB of storage). However
                            AIRport can also run in browser where it runs an SqlJs instance in memory. This
                            is where the difference really matters. If web AIRport has 10 repositories
                            loaded with just 1000 records each the UuIds alone will take up 5MB worth of RAM.
                            As of 2022 IPhone 14s will come with 6GB or RAM (only). And, since there is no
                            way to tell how much data users will keep in web AIRports or how long living web
                            AIRport instances will be, every byte matters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this reason I'm still keeping UuIds normalized in their own tables and
                            require joining to these tables to retrieve them. Of course joining more tables
                            in queries has a negative impact on performace as well, but Actor and Repository
                            are much smaller tables (especially on Mobile devices) and impact is minimal.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Usability</h2>
                        <p>
                            But the main issue with raw AIRport UuIds is usability. Not only do you have
                            to include the related entities in queries but you also have to properly query
                            them, which can be very error prone. On top of that, if you want to use these
                            ids as part of a link you now have to manually compose them into a single string
                            and decompose them at query time.
                        </p>
                        <h2>New whole "UuId"</h2>
                        <p>
                            For this reason from now on all Repository Entities now include a transient "UuId" field:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>@MappedSuperclass()
<b>export class</b> AirEntity {

    ....

    @Transient()
    uuId: <b>string</b>

}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            This field is implemented with a getter/setter pair. These are defined when
                            the record is recieved from the framework (by either an AIRport App or anything that
                            invokes APIs).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All the getter does is grab the uuids and the actorRecordId and concatenate them
                            into one large uuId:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>'IPFS-QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLj9Zm1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000-123'</code></pre>

                        <h2>Automatic Retrieval</h2>
                        <p>
                            Prior to addition of uuId field querying for it required joining the Repository
                            and Actor entities:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><b>export class</b> MyRecordDao {

    <b>async</b> findMyRecordsWithNestedRecords() {
        <b>let</b> m: QMyRecord
        <b>return await this</b>._find({
            select: {
                '*': Y,
                repository: {
                    uuId: Y
                },
                actor: {
                    uuId: Y
                }
                nested: {}
            },
            from: [
                m = Q.MyRecord,
                m.repository.innerJoin(),
                m.actor.innerJoin()
            ]
        })
    }
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Now you can query by the "uuId" field directly, without having to explicitly
                            specify the related select clause framents and joins.
                            While the "uuId" field is @Transient an exception is made in its case and it
                            can be used for querying (just like peristent fields):
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><b>export class</b> MyDao {

    <b>async</b> findMyRecordsWithNestedRecords() {
        <b>return await this</b>._find({
            select: {
                '*': Y,
                uuId: Y,
                nested: {}
            }
        })
    }
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Note that it is not included with all of the persisted records in '*' and
                            must be specified explicitly in the query to be retrieved.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Easier Queries</h2>
                        <p>
                            To make querying "by uuId" easier Dao also includes the "findByUuId" method
                            which takes the composite UuId, and automatically constructs the necessary
                            join to query the record.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For easy querying in joins all Query entites now include
                            an "equals" and "in" methods that allow for joining by the composite UuId
                            (or just joining to another entity by a Query Object or actual object
                            references).
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><b>export class</b> MyDao {

    <b>async</b> myFind(
        compositeBUuId: <b>string</b>,
        compositeCUuIds: <b>string</b>[],

        <b>let</b> m: QMyRecord,
            b: QMyBRecord,

                        <h2>Final effect</h2>
                        <p>
                            Putting in this tooling makes AIRport UUID scheme much more
                            developer friendly. The Application developer now work with
                            the 'uuId' field directly and don't have interface with the
                            underlying support table structure.
