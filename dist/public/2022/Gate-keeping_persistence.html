                            AIRport has a very useful feature: all objects passed into
                            @Api() methods get updated with the latest state (when
                            they are returned back to the Client). This is very
                            useful - the Client doesn't have to re-query the object
                            to get the latest state: less code to write and
                            maintain (and faster applications). But, there may be cases
                            where this becomes problematic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AIRport uses <a
                                href="https://autonomousinterdependentrepositories.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/entity-management/">hidden
                                state in the entity objects</a> to
                            keep track of the original state of those objects. This
                            was done to avoid the complexity of managing a database
                            session (a la Hibernate) and also removes the need for
                            an extra query to get the original state of an object
                            (when performing an update on that object). Plus,
                            querying for the current state of an object in the
                            database does not work when that object was modified
                            by another operation. This is expecially true for modern
                            SPA applications where the user might keep the page with
                            modifications open for a long period of time, before
                            submitting. In that case, modifications made
                            by the other (remote) operation will get inadvertently
                            reverted.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The edge case</h2>
                        <p>
                            There is an edge case in AIRport where an object might be
                            saved even if the developer did not intend
                            to save it. This will happen if the user modifies the
                            object in the Client and then passes it in as a nested object
                            to a "save" operation of another object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is an anti-pattern and really should never be done
                            by developers. And even if this happens, it is largely
                            mitigated by AIRport running "save"s <a
                                href="https://beyond-decentralized.world/2022/Cross-Repository_operations.html">
                                within repository boundaries</a>.  Since
                            repositories are meant to be small and focused (and often
                            time-bound) the chances of the Client wanting to perform
                            multiple update operations in separate @Api() calls (and making
                            all of the modifications before calling either one of
                            the @Api() calls) are slim to none. But, it is technically
                            possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example in <a
                                href="https://votecube.com/#!/poll/info/Cube/vote/kBSVLFHn01lMtvPXYIzu/4vz9cPyZiMoaGG4JOh6t">
                                Votecube</a>
                            (the first application being written with AIRport) Ideas
                            can stem from other Ideas.  When saving a new idea the
                            parent idea is passed in to signify that this is the case.
                            The Votecube App wants to persist the child Idea but doesn't
                            want to update the parent (in case it was modified for some
                            reason).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the case described above Ideas will live in separate
                            repositories and the operation will be repository-scoped
                            (as is the default case for AIRport).  But one could
                            imagine a scenario where a @CrossRepository operation
                            passes in an object graph and some of the objects
                            where modified in the Client (possibly inadvertently
                            and weren't intended for persistence).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that this really isn't any different from
                            the current state of things. This is exactly how
                            a save operation will work in Hibernate. But,
                            unfortunatelly I can't think of any way to make
                            AIRport handle this better, besides it's nature
                            of breaking data into Repositories.
