                            AIRport Id scheme <a href="https://dataindependence.net/blog/2022/AIR_UuId.html">has an
                                optimization</a>
                            for local storage of globally unique Ids. It is a limiting factor
                            that is leading to a new way of doing things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AIRport runs both on the client and the server. On the client
                            it runs in a separate browser tab (or as a native app). There
                            it manages the user's data directly without any
                            intermediate third party servers. The user can trust third
                            party code better on their device than anywhere else. In
                            effect they get their own server every time they use AIRport and
                            (given that all application code can be inspected) this is as close
                            as we can currently get to no third party interference with
                            user data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the client everything is pretty straightforward - you get one
                            local database where all your repositories are stored.
                            The local integer Id scheme works well there,
                            it saves space and query time. UuIds are only retrieved
                            when you have to look objects up in other repositories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Technically on the server the same thing holds true. All
                            of the integer ids are unique to the server and still work just
                            fine. However, when one looks further into what AIRport can
                            do an number new scenarios become apparent where numeric Id
                            scheme does not work.

                            Problem I: Decentralized & distributed
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This scheme starts to break down when you start mixing the two.
                            AIRport applications are meant to be run with some of the
                            data coming from centralized (though distributed) servers
                            and some of the data being decentralized. This mix gives you
                            the best combination of utility and privacy. But this could
                            lead to Id conflicts in the UIs if both distributed and
                            decentralized data needs to be displayed on the same screen.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Problem II: Back-end distributed
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            On the server side, the main goal of AIRport is to allow
                            application servers to load data from multiple completely
                            independent data sources. The idea is for every jurisdiction
                            to maintain its own data. This can (and at least at first will be)
                            accomplished by having geographically distributed databases
                            like <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a>.
                            But eventually AIRport application servers will support getting
                            data from completely different databases that have the same
                            schemas. This is particularly useful when an app server is
                            processing data across multiple governmental agencies or when
                            its processing data of separate corporations that are not
                            associated with each other.

                            Problem III: Performance
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Finally there is the problem of performance. In AIRport's case,
                            wide column databases are about an order of magnitude faster.
                            AIRport is particularly well suited for retrieving
                            entire Repositories from wide-column databases: the
                            repository record schema is extremely simple, it just
                            has the transaction log entries that are stored as blobs. Thus,
                            the eventual goal of AIRport on the server side is to perform all
                            repository-scoped SQL operations in memory of the application server
                            and just load the data from a wide column storage engine,
                            like <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a>.
                            Basically, repositories will be loaded into an in-memory SQL database
                            in their entirety (repositories are meant to be small and focused).
                            All of the operations that are contained within a repository will
                            be done directly in memory. Cross-repository queries will still go
                            to the distributed relational databases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Performance can be further enhanced by keeping the frequently
                            accessed repositories in memory even after their requests are
                            completed. The app server will then query the wide
                            column database where repository is archived for new transaction
                            log entries. This is where numeric ids in records, vs string ids
                            can really help to store more data in app server memory, especially
                            for smaller records. And for the Web implementation of AIRport,
                            all repositories are stored in memory (with SqlJs).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, the numeric Ids for repositories and actors are unique only
                            to the in-memory SQL database that is running on the application
                            server. Thus they cannot be relied upon for persistence
                            operations, when those operations go to another application
                            server (because UIs aren't expected to maintain server
                            sessions).

                        <h2>
                            The solution

                        <p>
                            And, as I have just realized there is a very elegant solution to
                            these problems. A solution that does not require storing <a
                                href="AIR_UuId.html#performance">very long</a> global UUIDs
                            as strings in every record (which would really matter on mobile
                            devices):
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            On the client
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The main problem on the client is that the UI might talk to different
                            AIRport servers and get records from them. In turn, these records
                            might have conflicting numeric ids (for Repositories and Actors). This
                            would cause an incorrect display of results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The multiple server scenario is important because AIRport is designed
                            for UIs that will be running against their own servers and the local
                            <a href="https://turbase.org/">Turbase</a> at the same time.
                        </p>

                            "Air Bridge"
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The solution is to always bundle a small AIRport library (airbridge)
                            in your code and let it aggregate and re-Id all of the data. This implies
                            that there will be a new (internal) format for query results that will
                            include all of the Repository and Actor records present in the result (as a separate
                            descriptor). The library would then simply populate those records in every
                            record of the result set. Of course this helps in the standard case
                            where there is only one server you are talking to as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the way back to the server the library will split and direct repository
                            requests to the correct servers (by parsing the repository UuId and
                            finding where the request should go). This will also save network
                            bandwidth by passing in Repository and Actor records only once.
                        </p>

                            Transparent UuId queries
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            This approach also takes care of the inelegant problem of having to add a 'uuId'
                            field in the query engine which looks really weird to the untrained eye
                            and can hurt adaption:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
this._find({
    select: {
        '*': Y,
        uuId: Y,
        anotherEntity: {}
    }
})
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The natural question when one sees this syntax for the first time is:
                            "If you are doing SELECT * why are you also including another field?"
                            This can throw developers off and make them think that they don't
                            get what is going on here and lose confidence in their ability
                            to just switch to AIRport without any learning curve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the new solution AIRport will simply collect all of the numeric
                            ids on the returned results and do two more queries:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
select: {},
from: [
    r = Q.Repository
],
where: r.id.in(repositoryNumericIds)

select: {},
from: [
    a = Q.Actor
],
where: a.id.in(actorNumericIds)
</code></pre>

                        <p>
                            This seems like a high price to pay - 3 queries instead of one. But
                            it really only impacts performance on the most trivial of queries,
                            where only one table is queried by Id (really fast). And the
                            alternative would be to join the simple query to Repository and Actor
                            entities anyway.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, this approach actually becomes faster than the alternative with
                            larger queries, where every entity in the select statement would have
                            to be separately joined to Repository and Actor. Also the
                            native result set in memory (which is always just a table with
                            every possible combination of records) becomes much smaller, reducing
                            both memory and CPU requirements to process it. This also enables
                            returning the entire Repository record and the Users behind Actors
                            and the owning User of the Repository, almost for free. This is true since
                            the implementation of _find and _findOne methods returns interlinked
                            object graphs where the same Repository, Actor and User objects
                            are pointed to by any number of referencing objects.

                            On the server

                        <p>
                            On the server the situation is slightly different. Application server
                            receives records from the UI and persists them. If it has a local
                            cache and already has the passed in Repository in it, then the Repository
                            and Actor numeric Ids will likely be different from what is coming from
                            the UI.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also there may be a duality of Ids between the underlying distributed
                            database and the in-memory database on the app server (especially if
                            the app server is talking to multiple separate databases).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having an internal format for passing in objects solves this issue. The
                            UUIDs are always passed in and numeric ides are converted to the values
                            the app server in it's cache (and to the values in the central
                            distributed database). An alike adapter can be used to manage multi
                            database (with same schemas) connections to the app server, once
                            that becomes relevant.
