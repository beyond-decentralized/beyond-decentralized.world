                            A key feature of AIRport framework is the ability of applications to interoperate.
                            This is possible because of two reasons:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                For reads, applications can create @ManyToOne relationships to tables
                                of existing schemas. And any application can query for all data in device's
                                database (across all application schemas, if permitted).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                AIRport persists all entities across application schemas and invokes all
                                necessary validation and business logic.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Read Queries</h2>
                        <p>
                            Management of read queries is pretty strait forward. The raw AIRport framework is
                            not concerned with it since no modifications are made. For Turbase, it is possible
                            figure out what part of the query belongs to which application and apply necessary
                            permissions as well as split advertisement revenue between them.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Modifications</h2>
                        <p>
                            My initial thoughts on how to support saving of nested entities was to have support
                            for nested save calls. However that does not support execution of any validation
                            and business logic that applications may want to do before the entities are saved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, the final version of Application Interoperability allows applications to
                            call APIs of other applications to execute modificaition logic for the apps that
                            manage nested entities. Ability to invoke APIs of other applications would be
                            implemented in any case. However, relying on it for persistence of nested objects
                            makes the overall approach more intuitive. To accommodate for that objects that
                            are passed into a save call of a particular application will be ignored if they do not
                            belong to that application. This of course means that the persistence of nested
                            objects will have to be done in the right order to work for newly created entities.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Project Types</h2>
                        <p>
                            The final version of Application Interoperability has 3 types of projects for each
                            application:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Default</li>
                            <li>Runtime</li>
                            <li>Client</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Default</h3>
                        <p>
                            The default project is what the developer creates explicitly. It contains
                            all of the core code for the application: DDL, DAOs, API. It also contains
                            generated sources for the query API and other auxiliary logic. It's main
                            file is "src/generated/api.ts". It does not include any of the
                            non-generated code and instead includes generated wrappers around each
                            of the API classes for the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The default project does include the generated query objects. This is
                            because the default project is what other applications use as a
                            dependency. Other apps can either call the pre-defined API methods (in
                            which case the calls are passed back to the framework and are executed
                            in the runtime version of the app), or run queries using generated query
                            objects.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Runtime</h3>
                        <p>
                            The runtime project is nested within the default project inside a
                            'runtime' directory. It will be completely generated and will have
                            all of the dependencies needed to build a runtime application. It
                            will also contain the build script and generate a bundle that will
                            deploy the full version of the application. This is the project
                            that actually includes the sources from the DDLs, DAOs and APIs of
                            the default project because its the 'runtime' project that will
                            actually be executing the application code.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Client</h3>
                        <p>
                            The client project is also nested within the default project (
                            inside the 'client' directory). It will also be completely generated
                            and will include a non-injected wrappers around all of the app's APIs.
                            These are the wrappers that will be called by external clients. They
                            are not injected by AIRport dependency injection framework since the
                            external client does not run inside AIRport - the wrappers have to
                            be 'new'ed to be used. The wrappers will forward the calls to the
                            AIRport framework (running in a separate tab or as a native
                            application), which will forward them to the application (which is
                            either nested in an IFrame, inside the framework tab, or is running in
                            a V8 isolate of the native application for the framework). The client
                            project also includes all of the generated interfaces for the DDL
                            objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm still thinking of whether to include the DDL objects themselves.
                            Theoretically they shouldn't have any business logic and the only
                            benefit of including them is ability to use entity names (instead of
                            the names of generated interfaces, which are prefixed with the letter
                            'I').
                        </p>
                        <h2>Transactions</h2>
                        <p>
                            Another issue that so far has not been decided on is transactionality. My prior
                            thoughts were to either add support for @Transactional() methods or to allow for
                            explicit calls to the "transactional" function. However for AIRport all
                            transactions always go into the same database and there is no need for JPA style
                            transactions. Really all calls made via a particular API should always belong
                            to the same transaction. And if that API call is nested in another API call,
                            all of the operations in this API should be included in the transaction of the
                            outer API call.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hence, the final solution is to make every @Api() method transactional. If an
                            @Api() method is called from another @Api() method it is automatically included in
                            the transaction of the parent method. In the future support for @Transactional()
                            methods may be included if the need for that arises.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To allow for multiple read calls to go through while a write @Api() call is in
                            progress, @Api({ readOnly: true }) will be supported (eventually). A read-only
                            @Api() call will be allowed to execute while a write-enabled @Api() call is in
                            progress. If a read-only @Api() call attempts to execute a write statement it
                            will throw an exception. If a write @Api() call is nested inside a read-only
                            @Api() call, it will block and wait for any executing write @Api() calls
                            before completing.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How it's done</h3>
                        <p>
                            The way this will be done is via keeping track of nested @Api() calls with a
                            call stack. When the first @Api() call is made a transaction is started. That
                            transaction is maintained until that @Api() call returns a value, at which point
                            the transaction is committed. The nested @Api() call is stored in a stack of
                            parent-child TRANSACTION_IDs, when a child @Api() call is started a child
                            TRANSACTION_ID is generated and is passed into the the called application. When
                            the called @Api() returns, it returns it's child TRANSACTION_ID and that
                            call is popped off the stack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This implementation also helps track @Api() calls from other UIs and Apps that
                            are not nested in the current transaction. Such calls are put into a separate
                            FIFO queue and are executed subsequently. Read-only calls are executed
                            immediately.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Rolling Back</h3>
                        <p>
                            AIRport is based on SQLite, which supports SAVEPOINT and RELEASE TO statements.
                            This enables fine grained handling of nested @Api() transactions. Whenever a
                            nested non-read-only @Api() is called (and also for the outer most call)
                            following command is issued:
                        <pre><code>SAVEPOINT $TRANSACTION_ID</code></pre>
                        When an @Api() successfully returns following command is issued:
                        <pre><code>RELEASE SAVEPOINT $TRANSACTION_ID</code></pre>
                        If an @Api() throws an exception following command is issued:
                        <pre><code>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT $TRANSACTION_ID</code></pre>

                        This allows for automatic management transactions in a nested @Api() call,
                        without having to rollback the entire transaction.

                        To allow for management of savepoints within an @Api() call, the following()
                        commands will be available:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>const savePointId = savepoint()
release(savePointId)
rollbackTo(savePointId)</code></pre>
