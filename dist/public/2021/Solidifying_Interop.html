                        <p>With logic running in isloates there will be locally-run,
                            vetted components. This brings up the problem of
                            validating and (with the save
                            operation) cascading joins across schemas. Here is my first take
                            on how it can be solved (along with the first take on schema
                            permissions).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Authentic schema & logic (7/2/2022 will be stored in a specialized Repository)</h2>
                        <p>
                            Because the schema library code is signed by the private key
                            of it's creator, schema code can easily be proven to be
                            authentic. The only external requirement is the schema creator's
                            public key placed in a predetermined path of their website. If
                            the signature matches then AIRport knows that the specified
                            schema came from the correct domain, the same domain that the
                            user can check for the features of the application and make
                            the determination of installing the schema in the first place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides basic assurance of having authentic schemas this also
                            enables schema creators to provide access rules for their
                            schemas. My initial thoughts are that schema creators can
                            specify while and black lists for what schemas from other
                            domains can access. A new "accessRules" directory under "src"
                            will be provided for that purpose. The creators will place
                            access rules classes under it which will have something like
                            the following:

                        <p>
                            These rules reference already defined operations. They will be parsed at
                            build time and will be converted into
                            a JSON definition that will be read by the core framework at runtime.
                            <br>
                            The above case illustrates the most basic save API - a Parent object with any combination
                            of properties, values and child objects will be accepted (as long as they pass the
                            schema validation rules of the database).
                            <br>
                            But let's say the schema developer wants to do some structural and basic value validation
                            on the passed in entities. Well a declarative way to do so appears to be the most
                            natural (and most readable) choice.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
<b>export class</b> ParentDao extends BaseParentDao {

    @Api()
    @ParentDao.Save({
        key: Y,
        value: Y
    })
    saveChildless;

    @Api()
    @ParentDao.Save({
        key: Y,
        value: Y,
        children: [{
            key: Y,
            value: Y
        }]
    })
    saveWithChildren;

}
                    </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            In the above example there are two distinct APIs, one accepts Parent entity by itself only,
                            and the other accepts Parent entity with children. These are very easy to read and
                            understand
                            and make perfect sense at a glance. However, they are limited in functionality and
                            saveWithChildren is a bit ambiguous - will it work if no children objects are passed in?
                            More functionality can be added to these structural rules, but at a cost of some
                            readability:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code>
<b>export class</b> ParentDao extends BaseParentDao {

    @Api()
    @ParentDao.Save({
        key: Y,
        value: 'A'
    })
    saveChildless;

    @Api()
    @ParentDao.Save({
        key: Y,
        value: 'A' || 'B',
        children: [{
            key: Y,
            value: null || 'A' || 'B'
        }, some(0, 2, {
            key: Y,
            value: 'C' || 'D'
        }), any(2)] || null
    })
    saveWithChildren;

}
                    </code></pre>

                        <p>
                            The above example is very precise in what values and child objects it will accept,
                            even declaring a range on the number of child objects and specifying that no child
                            objects is also OK for saveWithChildren. But this comes at a cost of having to support
                            the logical OR (||) operator as well as a static invocation of functions. But
                            more importantly it is now harder to read and takes some effort to understand
                            (makes sense logically but is a mix of declarations and code).
                            <br>
                            Moreover, the schema developer can take over and manually specify additional validation
                            (that just can't be easily described in a simple, declarative manner):
                        </p>

                            Finally, the schema developer may decide to completely lock down their API
                            and provide a custom API that does not expose the Dao.save call:

                                href="../2022/Application_Interoperability.html">@Api()</a>)</h2>
                        <p>
                            This scheme enables a fine-grained control over cross-schema persistence
                            of the objects via either exposing or hiding .save access. If .save is exposed
                            via @Api() then another schema can use it automatically. When it's entities are
                            saved, any entities from other schemas that are passed in object graph
                            will also be saved, assuming that the other schema's .save validation rules
                            pass. If no .save calls are exposed then the developers another schema will
                            be forced to use the CustomApi in a @Transactional() context
                        </p>

                        <h3>@Transactional() is back</h3>
                        <p>This reminds me to mention something that I missed in the last post, with
                            custom schema logic @Transactional() methods are back. This means that it's
                            very natural and simple to make complex transactions that might not only
                            do .save calls but also embedded queries, inserts, updates and deletes.</p>

                        <h2>Remembering the old schema (7/2/2022 - obsoleted, will be rudimentary at first)</h2>
                        <p>
                            The above also allows for more natural schema upgrades
                            The basic concept behind new schema upgrades is that new versions
                            of the schema can (voluntarily) retain .save APIs form previous versions of
                            the schema, but with new adjustment logic that coverts the old entity format
                            to the new schema. This allows Apps that are using
                            older versions of the schema to still function (for example during a deprecation
                            period). Also, this keeps the framework simple and gives schema developers the choice
                            (and the responsibility) of either maintaining or not maintaining backward
                            compatibility for their schemas, across as many versions as they see fit. They
                            should be motivated by the fact that they are monetarily rewarded when their
                            schema is used and maintain backward compatibility indefinitely.

                            To make this work AIRport will now retain older versions of the generated
                            entity APIs in special sub-folders of the src/generated folder. So,
                            for Parent, along with normal IParent there will also be IParent_1_0_0,
                            IParent_2_0_0 and so on - one file for each version of the schema.
                            This does bloat the project but not the run-time code since these are just
                            interfaces.

                            This, of course, does not solve the problem of other schemas having queries
                            that join against older versions of the tables. To fix this a new
                            src/views directory will be provided with 1_0_0, 2_0_0 (and so on) sub-folders
                            each of these sub-folders will contain logic that will maintain views
                            of older versions of the tables so that they may be used by other schemas
                            that have not yet upgraded.

                        <h3>Naturally migrating data</h3>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, having custom executable logic allows for very natural data
                            migration code to be written as part of the regular schema code. A new
                            src/dataMigration folder will be provided for that purpose, with 2_0_0,
                            3_0_0 (and so on) sub-folders. Each of these sub-folders will contain
                            the logic necessary to migrate data in existing schemas versions to new
                            versions, as well as to the DDL to add/remove columns, tables, indexes
                            and views. But that is a topic for future discussion ...
