                        Recently I got the inital implementation of application isolates working
                        (in browser only, without pulling application code from remote location)
                        and as part of that did a pass on API implementations.

                        <h2>Locking down APIs</h2>
                        One thing that is likely be needed in the future is the ability to differentiate
                        between "Application APIs" and "External APIs". An Application developer
                        should be able to lock down APIs to be either other Application facing
                        or External facing (like web UI, or anything else not running in an App
                        isolate).
                        <br>
                        This can be accomplished by adding more precision to the @Api decorator:
                        <code>
                            <pre>
@Injectable()
<b>export class</b> AnApiClass {

    @Api({ applications: true, external: true})
    <b>async</b> anApi(): any {
        ...
    }        
}
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                        Current thinking is to leave the API wide open by default and allow the
                        developers to lock it down as needed.

                        <h2>AIRport path</h2>
                        One of the tradeoffs that AIRport had to make is to give up some of
                        the elegance when it comes to deleting records but instead not have
                        to maintain a session.
                        <br>
                        I sent quite a bit of time developing with Hibernate (in Java world).
                        It is a great piece of technology but one thing I never liked about
                        it is the fact that entities can be attached and detached from the
                        ORM session. For INSERTs vs UPDATEs AIRport
                        <a
                            href="https://autonomousinterdependentrepositories.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/entity-management/">
                            got around this
                        </a>
                        by maintaing an __originalValues__ property on each object retrieved
                        from the database and diffing it with the passed in values on the
                        "save" operation. But DELETEs cannot be just as easily maintained.

                        <h2>Ackward DELETEs</h2>
                        The best I can come with for deletes so far is the following:
                        <code>
                            <pre>
  /*
   * Marks the object as deleted in 
   */
  markAsDeleted(record)

  /*
   * True if record is deleted, false otherwise
   */
  isDeleted(record)
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                        This API allows the developers to explicitly mark a given
                        object as deleted and also detect if an object has been
                        marked as deleted. This delete API is rather crude but
                        purposely makes the "save" operation the segway for
                        all entity based insert, update and delete operations (
                        there is also no explicit update for entity API). Of
                        course the developers are always free to write explicit
                        update and delete statements, expecially for bulk operations.

                        <h3>Rare deletes</h3>
                        It is worth noting that I don't exect deletes to be a
                        common operation. There really shouldn't be much
                        reason to delete records, expecially since they can
                        be split into time bound Repositories and archived
                        when no longer actively needed. On top of that in AIRport
                        no data is really ever deleted since it is preseved in the
                        transaction logs. Hence I don't exect high usage for the
                        delete operation, just lots of archiving.

                        <h2>Locking down object state</h2>
                        Thinking about deletes made me realize that one more API lockdown
                        can be added to @Api - ability to pass in Object State.
                        <br>
                        Object state is what keeps track of if the object has been deleted or
                        not and what the original values of the object were. It is possible
                        that the application developer wants to maintain all CRUD logic
                        internally to the application (at least on certain APIs). If that's
                        the case AIRport can accomidate that but scrubbing all object State
                        when an API is called.
                        <code>
                            <pre>
@Injectable()
<b>export class</b> AnApiClass {

    @Api({ objectState: true})
    <b>async</b> anApi(): any {
        ...
    }        
}
                            </pre>
                        </code>

                        Again the default will be to leave the API open to external
                        modifications, at this point it is hard to determine what will
                        likely be the most common scenario - direct modifications from
                        modern think UIs or more traditional lockdown approach of
                        server side development.

                        <h2>@SaveEntryPoint()</h2>
                        To build on top of <a href="./Solidifying_Interop.html">initial
                            application interability thoughts</a> I'm proposing a new
                        decorator to mark points where save operations can cascade. As
                        a recap - save operations that cross application schema boundaries
                        will call into the logic of the Applications that contain the
                        schemas with nested objects. That way the application always
                        has control over how the objects in it's schema get saved
                        and can run the necessary validation logic to make sure
                        that records are maintained in a proper order.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A accomplish this a new @SaveEntryPoint() decorator will
                        be introduced. A method decorated with this decorator will always
                        take an array of the corresponding entity objects and nothing else
                        and there may only be one @EntitySave() method per entity type.
                        This is necessary for the framework to make a determination what
                        method to invoke for a given entity- if there is more than one than
                        it becomes unclear what method to invoke. Note that for any given
                        save operation, this acts as an entry point. The entire object
                        sub-graph that belongs to this Application's schema will be
                        processed without calling any other @SaveEntryPoint()s for nested
                        objects.
