                        <p>I've now come to a full realization of what logic in isloates
                            mean - locally-run vetted components. This trully changes
                            the way AIRport applications can be written. Apps are no
                            longer required to maintain expensive (to most people on
                            the planet) server side components. Also that allows for a
                            degree of independent developer specialization that is already
                            standard among most professional programmers and UI designers.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Any component not just schema</h2>
                        <p>
                            A few days ago it hit me - logic running in V8 isolates does
                            not necesarily need to be tied to schemas. It can just as
                            easily be logic that uses other schemas, without providing
                            its own. And it can even be logic that does not use any
                            schemas directly and only uses other components. Or, even
                            using no components at all, itself being a core library used
                            by others.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Serverless components and apps</h2>
                        <p>
                            This opens the door to an even greater degree of composability
                            and reusability of AIRport components. Different components
                            can slice and dice the data in different ways to arrive at
                            different result types, meant for any number of different
                            purposes. They can join together any number of schemas in
                            any number ways leading to an invinite number of possibilites
                            for how data is combined and used. This was also possible
                            before but the logic running those schemas could not be
                            vetted without relying on external public keys and checking
                            the signature of evey request, and therefore a necessary
                            backend component for evey app to sign those requests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now component authenticily can be verified without any server
                            side components. The libraries themselves can be signed at
                            developement time and the public key can be provided as a
                            resource on a static page (backed by decetralized technologies
                            like IPFS and Arweave). This reduces the maintenance
                            costs of complex "relation database based" Apps down to an
                            annual domain registration fee and one time payment (as is the
                            case with Arweave) for application deployment. This trully
                            lowing the barrier for entry into app development to anybody
                            on the planet that can code, no matter what part of the world
                            they live in and how much money they have. Even the
                            maintenance of a domain name isn't required, as long as the
                            developer doesn't need it for their branding.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Division of labor</h3>
                        <p>
                            What'seven more exiting is that business (and other complex)
                            logic is no longer driven to the outside apps where it would
                            be bundled with UIs. With the V8 isolates complex logic can
                            now be provided without any UIs and external UIs can now come
                            without any complex logic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This allows even smaller groups of developers or even
                            individuals to contribute to the ecosystem and realize
                            monetary gains from it. From personal experience I know that
                            as a backend developer it took me years of practice to get
                            proficient at building good UIs (let alone at designing
                            them I still float). With vetted logic in Airport, a really
                            good backend developer can focus on writing very useful
                            components and not worry about having to bundle a UI (that
                            they aren't necessarily used to writing). While a web designer
                            can now design a very good UI and plug it into the components
                            written by the above mentioned back-end developer. And all
                            without requiring a larger organization that would have to keep
                            both them on staff and purse goal related more to money making
                            than creativity. Now both of them can create functional
                            product and fully utilize their creative potential as
                            unconstrained, independent actors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This effect greatly increases the number of developers that
                            can productively contribute to the AIRport echosystem while
                            remaining idependent. One no longer has to be good at
                            everything and therefore can be better at more focused tasks.
                            Even within back-end programming there can be a division of
                            labor since logic can now be split up into a greater number
                            of cooperating components. This was a main goal of AIRport
                            from the begging - democratization of application development
                            (while keeping data independent).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course with this approach a way of monetizing the efforts
                            of all developers (schema, logic, UI) will have to be devised.
                            The good thing is that with crypto currency splitting up micro
                            payments becomes much easier. The trick will be in determining
                            the value of each of the components relative to each other,
                            as the revenue is being split among them. Different users
                            can gain different quantity value from different components so
                            it will probably have to be done dynamically and separately on
                            each member device. The time for this functionality has not
                            yet come ...
