                        Internally Airport uses "on the stack", token based dependency injection
                        to allow for seamless framework upgrades on each device. However this
                        type of injection is non-standard and can throw schema developers off
                        (as something unfamiliar and therefore unnatural). With introduction of
                        isolates adding more tranditional constructor based dependency injection
                        scheme becomes possible.
                        <h2>Why "on the stack"?</h2>
                        Airport has it's own unique dependency injection system. It's adoption
                        was driven by the fact that Airport will run in non-controlled
                        environments - end user devices. On top of that it can have any number
                        of Apps access it (locally) at any given point in time (either
                        via user interaction or in the background). In such environments
                        performing framework upgrades becomes tricky - App's CRUD calls will
                        not work while the upgrade is happenning. And depending now how the
                        apps are written this can (and most probably will) lead to broken user
                        experiences. Being an upcoming framework Airport can risk being deleted
                        from User's devices if they are frustrated by possibly frequent outages
                        of service (realistically, the rate of bug fixes at the beginning will be
                        high).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Enter the typeless, on the stack dependency injection. Unlike constructor
                        based injection it allows to keep the non-upgraded classes the same after
                        the upgrade, with only the upgraded classes being reloaded in the VM. This
                        is combined with "request caching" during the upgrade process, which creates
                        a small time-window during which no active requests are going though the
                        system. Together they allow Airport to catch all incoming requests
                        and delay their execution while a fast upgrade is happening (a few classes
                        being quickly replaced on the fly) and then continue with serving those same
                        requests as if nothing has happened. All while the user if completely
                        oblivious to the fact that a bug has just been fixed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This makes for a much smoother user experience, which could make or break
                        Airport at the beginning, right when it will have to be patched frequently.
                        The user will be able to access the ungrade log, in case they
                        are curious or concerned with code being upgraded without their knowledge.
                        Eventually a setting can be added that will prompt the user for upgrades.
                        But this also makes for a more clunky developer experience. Every method
                        that uses other injectable objects now has to inject them explicitly (or
                        have them passed in via the execution context). Also the injection will
                        feel unnatural to the fast majority of developers because it uses tokens.

                        <h2>Isolate schemas are different</h2>

                        With the introduction of V8 isolates schema developers can now write code
                        that will be executable in a sandbox environment. This will expose the
                        "unnatural" nature of Airports current injection system and can become
                        a barrier to developer adoption.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The cool thing about isloate sandboxes is that upgrading them can be done
                        wholesale, or at least the 3rd party schema code, which will be deployed
                        via a separate bundle. Under the covers (in DAO superclasses) it will use
                        Airport IOC tokens to access the rest of the framework. All of the
                        requests coming to a schema isolate and to the core framework from
                        the schema isolate can be cached while the 3rd party bundle is loaded.
                        To make it all work, all API endpoint classes will also have Airport IOC
                        tokens (not exposed to the developer) so that they can be (re)loaded at
                        run time.

                        <h2>Angular style</h2>

                        The new dependency injection system will utilize the Angular style
                        @Injectable() decorators on the injectable classes. And the fact that
                        schemas are written in Typescript allows to determine types of
                        constructor parameters at build time and generate a library-wide
                        descriptor that keep track of which objects to inject where.

                        <h2>Client bundle</h2>
                        All Airport schemas provide a thin client bundle that allows to call
                        into the schemas. With the new approach stub objects will be generated
                        for all API classes of the schema that will contain API method
                        declarations (which will call into Airport). The application developers
                        can either instantiate these objects via standard "new Constructor()"
                        calls or extend these objects and inject them into a dependency
                        injection framework of their choice.

                        <h2>Happy, happy, joy joy!</h2>
                        This new approach makes me happy (personally) since I no longer have
                        to worry about explaining do developers token based injection or
                        about how exactly to split client-side tokens from the rest of schema
                        tokens. Hopefully this also will make the developers happy as
                        they should be right at home this with way of injecting dependencies.
