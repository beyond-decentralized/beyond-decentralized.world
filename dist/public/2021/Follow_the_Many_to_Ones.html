                        As the name states, Autonomous Interdependent Repositories are meant to be
                        interdependent. This basically means that records in one repository
                        can have columns with ids pointing to records in other repositories. In
                        itself its a simple concept however it presents a number of technical
                        issues when actually implemented.

                        <h2>Dealing with blank records</h2>
                        The core issue of having references to records in other repositories is
                        the fact that those other repositories may not be present at the AIRport
                        database in question.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This means that the records in the referencing repository have columns
                        with ids that will be pointing to records that do not exist. And that
                        is a "big no-no" in relational databases. In fact it's one of the main
                        selling points for relational DBs is ensuring that such cases are not
                        possible. So how to deal with this issue?

                        <h2>Try 1: Disable referential integrity</h2>
                        My first thoughts on this issue were - let's just disable referential
                        integrity in the database completely. This basically means no Foreign
                        Keys. That does solve the underlying issue but at the cost of disabling
                        all Foreign Keys completely, even for the records within a single
                        repository.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This shouldn't be too much of an issue given that AIRport framework is
                        the sole point of entry into the database. Referential integrity
                        can simply be checked by the framework. Though this does require
                        additional queries and slows down the modification operation operations
                        and thus certainly isn't an ideal solution.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another issue with this solution is that when AIR is used in bigger
                        installations (that might be aggregating data for many repositories)
                        and may be accessed by tools other that AIRport framework, there is
                        nothing that prevents data corruption (at least on referential
                        integrity level). Or even for the case of Turbase - the advertisement
                        engine will be written by a team of Statistical Analysis/AI experts
                        that won't likely be using AIRport and instead use whatever ORM they
                        prefer in Python.

                        <h2>Try 2: Create stub records</h2>
                        Later, when I revisited this issue another idea came to me - what
                        about creating stub records instead. This means that there will
                        now be records in the database which will be blank stubs and contain
                        only the primary key columns in them (Repository Id + Actor Id + Actor
                        Record Id).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This solves the referential integrity problem (Foreign Key columns
                        will now point to these stub records). However this introduces another
                        problem - what to do about fields in stub records that are stored in
                        NON NULL columns?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Again, NON NULL constraints is one of the main selling points of RDBMS
                        and disabling it just feels wrong. And again the framework can
                        handle it (now at a lesser cost of enforcing NOT NULL constraints for
                        non-stub records and not enforcing them for stub records). And
                        again this presents a problem for third party tools. Alternatively
                        NON NULL columns can be populated with default values (thus either
                        requiring default values for all NON NULL columns or a special
                        convention for defaults in NON NULL columns) but there is no way
                        for third party tools to know what is a default stub value and what is
                        a real value.

                        <h2>Try 3: Follow the @ManyToOne's</h2>
                        I'm currently finishing the Repository implementation and as part of
                        this effort I'm integrating the existing Votecube UI to have a
                        real world AIRport scenario. And in doing so I've come to a realization that
                        in order for repositories to be useful they will (at least sometimes)
                        need the data in other repositories which pointed to with Foreign
                        Keys. Thus a new idea came to me, why not just "follow" the
                        @ManyToOne relationships and drag all of that data along?

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This approach solves both the Referential Integrity and NOT NULL
                        constraint problems, without requiring any stub values. A new
                        complication is presented in the form of maintaining fragmented
                        records of the Repositories which are referenced via the @ManyToOne
                        relationships. If those repositories are later loaded they will
                        have to be replaced (unless they are in the same exact state as
                        in the referenced records). The implementation of this approach
                        will reveal any additional complications that may arise ...
