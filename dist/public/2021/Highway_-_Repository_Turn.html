                    <div class="entry__content">
                        <p>Recently I've have arrived at a breakthough in thinking about how
                            <a href="./Highway_The_Beginning.html">Highway</a> can be implemented
                            in a strait forward and simple way, provided that some assumptions
                            are kept about underlying data usage.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Repository usage patterns</h2>
                        <p>
                            The break-though came as a result of thinking about Repositories
                            and how repositories are intended to be used and shared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Repositories are meant to be autonomous units of knowledge that
                            are used across multiple applications and tie in all of the
                            functionality realted to that knowledge unit. What I was missing
                            before is that for the bulk of use cases any given UI will
                            present data for one repository at a time. In the cases where
                            UIs need to present data across repositories it is possible
                            to create new, aggregate repositories for that usecase and still
                            present the bulk of the data for one central repository.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
                        <p>
                            With these usage patterns in mind it is possible to constrain
                            all UI operations to a single repository (or a set of related
                            repositories). Then presenting a screen (or a set of
                            related screens) can become a matter of loading the repository
                            transaction logs (or in some cases, like a chat thread, just the
                            recent entries in the transaction log).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next piece of the puzzle is the fact that AIRport in its
                            entirety (from framework to client applications) is runnable in
                            the browser. Upon SPA intialization for of the application
                            it along with sql.js can be loaded into memory and subsequently
                            retrieve repository transaction logs from the server, turn them
                            into traditional relational data and serve complex queries needed
                            by the UI. The overall system diagram in that case can look like
                            this:
                        </p>
                        <img src="./images/Highway_diagram.png">
                        <p>
                            All of Highway write operations will be sent to an AIRport
                            installation on the server-side, where all of operations can be
                            propertly validated. Server-side AIRport will contain an
                            additional module that will write serialized transaction logs
                            to wide column storage, where they can be quickly retrieved
                            by the repository Id (and optionally a time-frame constraint).
                            In addition to that server-side AIRport can maintain a full
                            text search database, which will contain full text mappings
                            to a combination of Repository ID + timestamp of Transaction
                            Log entry that contains the match.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further details on this setup are yet to be flushed out but I'm
                            very excited about this approach. In my mind it represents
                            best of both worlds of centrialized data processing and
                            utilization of modern client side hardware. It should serve
                            the bulk of use-cases I can think of, while providing a fallback
                            schenario where querying the server-side relational database
                            is possible.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Observables as a bonus</h2>
                        <p>
                            A nice bonus to this approach is that it comes with a very
                            strait forward implemetation of observable behavior. The client
                            can simply subscribe to all new transaction log entries for a
                            given repository and then process the data to see if any
                            of the fields in the obserable query are affected by latest
                            entries. If they are updated, result will be sent to the UI.
                            Again everything in this approach keys off the fact that queries
                            will be limited by a Repository ID.
