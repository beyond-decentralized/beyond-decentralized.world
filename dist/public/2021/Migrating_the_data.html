                        Schema migrations are hard in general. In AIRport/Turbase schema migrations
                        are even harder for a number of reasons (in order of complexity):
                        <ul>
                            <li>Migration scripts must work across schema dependencies</li>
                            <li>Schemas need to be backward compatible with applications that use older versions</li>
                            <li>Both live data and serialized transaction logs must be migrated</li>
                            <li>Repositories must work across devices with different schema versions</li>
                        </ul>
                        The first entry in this list should have an algorithmic solution since circular dependencies
                        between schemas are disallowed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As discussed previously, backward compatibility can be accomplished with maintaining views
                        for read operations, while disallowing any modifications until the app is upgraded. The
                        solution presented today opens up a way to maintain backward write compatibility as well.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The solution to dual migration of live and serialized data has so far been to maintain
                        two different versions of migration scripts. This is of course very error prone and is
                        an unnecessary source of data migration bugs. Today's post aims to provide a single upgrade
                        path approach.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Making modifications to the same data across devices with different schema versions is
                        a tall order that I'm only now beginning to think about. But a key realization is
                        that it is tighly intertwined with live/serilized problem solution since both must support
                        concurrent modifications across schema versions. Most likely actually solving this (and
                        the above) problem will require input and work from many people (and lots and lots of testing).

                        <h2>Unifying live and serialized upgrades</h2>

                        A key insight in solving this issue appears to be: maintain insertable views for
                        each version of the schema. This way changes to an older version of the schema
                        will automatically propagate to whatever the latest version is installed on the
                        device. And when that version is itself upgraded it's older table versions
                        themselves become insertable views.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is a very elegant solution as it solves all of the currently known hard
                        problems of schema migration. Of course the way of actually accomplishing this
                        is yet to present itself, but a few facts will likely be present in the
                        implementation:

                        <h2>Virtual Views</h2>
                        The insertable views won't be traditional database views. Instead every operation
                        coming in will contain the schema version it's operating against. Since the API for
                        that version will already be based on that version there is no need to come up with
                        extra views. Instead AIRport will internally adjust the operations, based on
                        "migration view hooks" provided for the schema.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These hooks will have to be created on per column level and executed on per cell
                        level. This is because of inserts and updates, which may not be duable without the
                        ability to modify a cell (like inspect it and split into multiple columns). Luckly
                        this shouldn't be too hard to accomplish since AIRport already keeps track of all
                        changes on per row and per cell basis in order to maintain Repository history.

                        <h2>View Hooks</h2>
                        It's hard to say exactly how the view hooks will look but a desireable way is to keep
                        them declarative where possible and programmatic where necessary. For example, if
                        a column moved from one table to another then that can be specified declaratively.
                        But if a column got split into multiple ones, based on some logic then that will
                        have to be done programmatically.

                        <h2>DDL restrictions</h2>
                        There will likely have to be a number of DDL restrictions to make it all work. For
                        example, most definitely all new NON NULL columns will have to have a default value
                        in order to enable insertion from older views. Actually there probably won't be
                        any NON NULL columns that are not IDs, but that's a discussion for a different
                        post (related to how repositories will work).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another restriction likely to be required is disallowing column removal - columns
                        may only be expanded, renamed or moved to another table. Columns can be split
                        but cannot be deleted since that is loss of data that may be of interest for
                        inspection for repository history. Backward compatibily for older schema versions
                        probably won't have to be required (if a record got entered with into a new
                        schema version the old column value will just be NULL).

                        <h2>Multi-pass publishing system</h2>
                        In order to generate view harnesses (which will hopefully be the only required upgrade
                        logic) it makes sense to add a multi-pass publishing system consisting of
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Version
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Publish snapshot
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Publish
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        The harness will make it easy to plugin upgrade scripts. Per cell handlers will
                        be generated based on schema diffs (previous version vs new version).

                        <h3>Version</h3>
                        Whenever a new schema version is created the old version gets copied to a separate versioned
                        location. Older versions of the schema are kept around along with the old migration scripts
                        (and probably all of the logic, looking forward towards concurrent cross version modifications).
                        This also allows for automatic detection of major/minor/patch with diff of schema versions
                        during the schema verisiong process itself, with the tree types being (as usual):
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patch version - no schema changes, only code</li>
                            <li>Minor version - expansion of columns string (allowing for more characters) and number
                                (higher precision)
                                columns. Addition of nullable columns (NOT NULL columns won't be supported due to
                                how repositories will work, but more on that in the following post).
                                Addition of new tables.</li>
                            <li>
                                Major version - all other schema changes
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Snapshot publishing</h3>
                        Publishing is snapshot is beneficial to developers of applications that depend on this schema
                        they can start migrating their Apps to the latest schema version. Snapshots can be published
                        without data migration scripts being in place. Snapshots will also fix schema migration
                        scripts - once you publish a snapshot next version run will go from this snapshot (that is
                        it will diff the the last snapshot or publish against whatever new changes where provided,
                        though this can be made configurable)

                        <h3>Publish</h3>
                        Publish is the "big kahuna". Unlike snapshots it goes to end user devices and upgrades
                        existing production schemas. Schema developers should excersize courtesy towards App
                        developers that use their schema buy being on the lookout for snaphots from them. The
                        right time to publish a schema is when all dependent Apps have published mitigating
                        snapshots themselves.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One nice thing about this approach is that it standardizes when upgrade scripts can be
                        added. This means that the framework can generate the necessary harnesses that
                        will be called during schema migration, thus freeing the developer from the task
                        of wiring in the upgrade jobs into the upgrade system.

                        <h3>Details to come</h3>
                        This post only outlines the general approach for schema migration. Details will come
                        at a later point once actual implementation will take place.
