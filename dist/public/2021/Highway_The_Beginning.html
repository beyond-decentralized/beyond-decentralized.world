                        <p>I haven't head as much time as I have hoped to develop Highway last year.
                            So during the beginning of this year I'm focusing on
                            developing a prototype product based on Highway and developing
                            Highway itself in the process.</p>
                        <h2>Motivation behind Highway</h2>
                        <p>
                            As Airport applications will be developed it will be beneficial to
                            store some of the data of that application centrally. For example
                            a scheduling app might contain your own, family or group schedule
                            as well as schedules for public events. Highway is intended to
                            provide an implementation of the central storage solution behind
                            the same exact API as Airport will be using locally. With it you
                            would be using a single query definition to retrieve the data
                            from both the local AIR database as well as from a central
                            server. Likewise a single update statement would be used
                            to update either the local AIR database or a central storage
                            solution or both.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Technical Challenge</h2>
                        <p>
                            The trick with Highway is that past a certain scale serving
                            centrally located data from a relational database becomes
                            inefficient and just too expensive. There are other
                            technologies out there that the job of scaling a web app
                            much cheaper. Specifically full text search engines have
                            been developed to efficiently retrieve data based on a
                            free text query and document database have been developed
                            to very efficiently retrieve data based on an Id or some
                            other normalized querying means.
                        </p>
                        <p>The core insight that Highway utilizes (and attempts to
                            prove in the process) is that it should be possible to
                            declaratively map relational fields to fields or documents in
                            non-relational storage engines (or not fully relational
                            storage engines) and have the system automatically forward
                            qualifying queries to the right engines and automatically
                            update non-relational engines as the relational data
                            gets updated. And to do so in a performant and distributed
                            way.</p>
                        <h2>The approach</h2>
                        <p>For my initial implementation I've chosen
                            <a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a>
                            and
                            <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDb</a>
                            as the initial non-relational platforms to
                            implement Highway with. The idea for Highway
                            is to be flexible enough to incorporate just about
                            any kind of storage system into the mix. It will do
                            so by taking a technology specific set of decorators
                            and utilities and converting them into an internal,
                            implementation agnostic notation, which it will then
                            interpret at runtime and perform the required query and
                            data maintenance operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>Highway will also attempt to off-load as much computation
                            as possible to build-time, thereby arriving a very efficient
                            set of instructions that in needs to perform at run time
                            do do the necessary work.</p>
                        <p>Also at build-time Highway will provide a report of
                            which queries are being served from which storage engines and
                            which <a href="../2020/Transactionality.html">save/delete</a>
                            calls update them. It will also warn if there are queries
                            still being served from the relational db (if they haven't
                            specifically been marked as such) and also warn if there
                            are non-sql defined entities/documents that are not being maintained
                            but are being read from.</p>
                        <p>Finally Highway will provide hooks into the system
                            which will allow developers to add additional processing
                            at any stage of the process. I've done some preliminary
                            research and have chosen
                            <a href="https://node-ts.github.io/bus/">@node-ts/bus</a>
                            as the distributed application platform for that reason.
                        </p>
                        <p>Please stay tuned for specific examples as I start to
                            implement them... :)</p>
