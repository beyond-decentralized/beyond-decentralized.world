                    <p>I haven't head as much time as I have hoped to develop Highway last year.
                        So during the beginning of this year I'm focusing on
                        developing a prototype product based on Highway and developing
                        Highway itself in the process.</p>
                    <h2>Motivation behind Highway</h2>
                    <p>
                        As Airport applications will be developed it will be beneficial to
                        store some of the data of that application centrally. For example
                        a scheduling app might contain your own, family or group schedule
                        as well as schedules for public events. Highway is intended to
                        provide an implementation of the central storage solution behind
                        the same exact API as Airport will be using locally. With it you
                        would be using a single query definition to retrieve the data
                        from both the local AIR database as well as from a central
                        server. Likewise a single update statement would be used
                        to update either the local AIR database or a central storage
                        solution or both.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Technical Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        The trick with Highway is that past a certain scale serving
                        centrally located data from a relational database becomes
                        inefficient and just too expensive. There are other
                        technologies out there that the job of scaling a web app
                        much cheaper. Specifically full text search engines have
                        been developed to efficiently retrieve data based on a
                        free text query and document database have been developed
                        to very efficiently retrieve data based on an Id or some
                        other normalized querying means.
                    </p>
                    <p>The core insight that Highway utilizes (and attempts to
                        prove in the process) is that it should be possible to
                        declaratively map relational fields to fields or documents in
                        non-relational storage engines (or not fully relational
                        storage engines) and have the system automatically forward
                        qualifying queries to the right engines and automatically
                        update non-relational engines as the relational data
                        gets updated. And to do so in a performant and distributed
                        way.</p>
                    <h2>The approach</h2>
                    <p>For my initial implementation I've chosen
                        <a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a>
                        and
                        <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDb</a>
                        as the initial non-relational platforms to
                        implement Highway with. The idea for Highway
                        is to be flexible enough to incorporate just about
                        any kind of storage system into the mix. It will do
                        so by taking a technology specific set of decorators
                        and utilities and converting them into an internal,
                        implementation agnostic notation, which it will then
                        interpret at runtime and perform the required query and
                        data maintenance operations.</p>
                    <p>Highway will also attempt to off-load as much computation
                        as possible to build-time, thereby arriving a very efficient
                        set of instructions that in needs to perform at run time
                        do do the necessary work.</p>
                    <p>Also at build-time Highway will provide a report of
                        which queries are being served from which storage engines and
                        which <a href="../2020/Transactionality.html">save/delete</a>
                        calls update them. It will also warn if there are queries
                        still being served from the relational db (if they haven't
                        specifically been marked as such) and also warn if there
                        are non-sql defined entities/documents that are not being maintained
                        but are being read from.</p>
                    <p>Finally Highway will provide hooks into the system
                        which will allow developers to add additional processing
                        at any stage of the process. I've done some preliminary
                        research and have chosen
                        <a href="https://node-ts.github.io/bus/">@node-ts/bus</a>
                        as the distributed application platform for that reason.</p>
                    <p>Please stay tuned for specific examples as I start to
                        implement them... :)</p>
