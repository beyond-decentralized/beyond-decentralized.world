                        Unlike JPA/Hibernate, AIRport entity management is sessionless. The way
                        it accomplishes change detection is via
                        <a
                            href="https://autonomousinterdependentrepositories.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/entity-management/">
                            original values</a>
                        tracking in a hidden object property. Recently I've been debugging
                        Insert vs Update detection and realized that everything is easier with
                        Ids that are generated. If the Id is present in the input it cannot
                        be an Insert. That got me thinking - should all entities be forced
                        to have generated Ids?
                        <h2>Repository Entities - always generated Ids</h2>
                        Well, repository entities already have generated repository + Actor
                        specific repository Ids (each AIRport database acts as a unique actor for
                        a repository and hence it's auto-generated sequences are guaranteed
                        to be unique in a given repository for that Actor/database). Hence,
                        my next natural thought was - can all data in the database be
                        in repositories?
                        <h2>"Non-repository" data</h2>
                        Prior thought was that there was bound to be maintenance data
                        that wouldn't be tracked in user repositories and bundled with
                        the schema instead. Existance of such data is almost a certaintly.
                        Examples of such data are dropdown values, and other lookup data.
                        <h2>Everything is better in Repositories</h2>
                        Putting such data into repositories still works. In fact it makes
                        maintainance of such data much easier. Now data-only patches are
                        as easy as modifying data in the one of these publisher controlled
                        repositories.
                        <br>
                        Another thing this decoupling of code from data does is that it
                        allows entities other than publishers of the code provide different
                        seed data. This helps a lot of the application is a data driven,
                        generic piece of logic, meant to be customized/skinned based on
                        different data that users (or publishers of other apps) can
                        provide.
                        <br>
                        Even the original maintenance-data repository can be allowed to
                        be modified and enhanced by users or can be published with
                        read-only public facing permissions, or can be completely hidden
                        from the rest of the world (other than the application itself).
                        But more on that once the repository code is actually finished...
                        <h2>Technical details</h2>
                        Another piece of information that hasn't been fully thought out
                        until now is how exactly will Repositories with references to
                        other Repositories exist in the database if the referenced
                        repositories are not yet present in the database. The original
                        thought was to disable all foreign key constraints on all tables
                        and just have dangling references to non-existing records.
                        However this suffers from schema denormalization since
                        relations are no longer enforced.
                        <br>
                        The new way is to just to disallow NON NULL columns for everything
                        except record ids. This is also a form of denormalization but
                        at least it doesn't compromise relationship integrity. What it
                        does do is allow for is create stub records in the database, to keep
                        track of missing repository records. This is because such records
                        can exist with nothing but Id columns filled out (because
                        all other columns are NULL).
                        <br>
                        This can be taken a step further with in-code maintenance of NON
                        NULL constraints. That way NON NULL can still exist (virtually)
                        for normal data and will simply be ignored for stub records.
                        <h2>Still to come</h2>
                        The initial Repository implementation will be taking place very
                        soon and more details will be releaved as a result of that, stay
                        tuned ...
