                        The next step after code execution isolates and schema upgrade strategy
                        is defining exactly how schemas will be installed and how they will
                        run. Here is my first (detailed) take on it:
                        <h2>Artifacts</h2>
                        Schemas at runtime will consist of 4 separate piecies:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                JSON definition file
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Isolate library
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Client side library
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Checksum file
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        JSON definitions will contain the schema DDL. It will also
                        contain a list of all other schemas (and their versions) that this
                        schema depends on.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Isolate library is all of the server side logic that is needed by
                        the schema, stripped of all of it's dependencies. The core dependencies
                        will be automatically provided by the AIRport application. The schema
                        dependencies will be downloaded by AIRport application and loaded into
                        the same Isolate. The isloate library will be exposed via a special
                        "internal_index.ts" file that will tie in all of the files required.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Client side library will be a minimal set of runtime artifacts needed
                        to run a client. Presently the only thing that is needed is a small
                        shim (of 3 AIRport libraries, packaged separately to reduce redundancy)
                        and the definition of the tokens used for dependency injection. The
                        rest of the client side library (fronted by the usual "index.ts") will
                        consist of interfaces and won't have any run-time footprint.
                        <h2>Insuring authenticity</h2>
                        Lastly, checksum file will contain a checksum for (in the form of a
                        signature) that will ensure that the combination of the "JSON definition
                        file" and "Isolate library" have not been tampered with and are indeed
                        from the schema publisher.
                        <h2>Installation process</h2>
                        Installation of any given schema will come as a result of a client App
                        making an API call to it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The client side library will first attempt to invoke the local AIRport
                        App/server. If it's not found (not listening on the specified localhost
                        port) it will prompt the user to either install AIRport App or run
                        the client App in "demo mode" (demo mode will just open another tab
                        with the AIRport server running in window.postmesage mode).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once the installation handshake completed (and either the AIRport App
                        is running natively on the device or the demo tab is opened) the
                        client App will proceed with the initial API request. The request
                        will contain the schema signature in it (along with schema version,
                        the API object name, method name and call parameters). At that point,
                        AIRport App will:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Check if the schema is already installed. If it's not it will
                                download the requested version of the schema, verify the signature,
                                and install the schema DDL.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the schema is installed it will verify that the requested
                                version of the schema matches the installed one, if not it will
                                download the requested schema version and run the upgrade scripts
                                to get it the the latest version. If the schema has any other
                                schemas it depends on AIRport will check/install those schemas
                                before installing the requested schema.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the schema is installed and all initialization/upgrade
                                scripts have been run AIRport will load the library code into a
                                V8 isolate (either directly in the go code in the native app, or
                                in a separate child iframe).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                With the schema code loaded it will run the client App's request
                                and return the results.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>TBD schema lookup</h2>
                        I have more research to do on the process of looking up schemas. It should
                        be done in a way that is agnostic of the underlying storage technology
                        used to accomplish it. An easy solution would be to copy the Arweave GraphQL
                        API and do everything via a number of lookups:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                First lookup the schema by the "signature" tag
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Lookup the specified publisher via their "id" tag (to load their
                                public key).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Of course all of this will need to be implemented. That will have to come
                        later, as I'm now busy with implementing the core framework so stay tuned
                        for next year! :)
