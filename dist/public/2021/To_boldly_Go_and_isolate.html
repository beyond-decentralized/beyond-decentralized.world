                    <h2>The solution to natural DAO logic</h2>
                    <p>For quite a while now I've been dreading having to write Firebase-like rules
                        for mutation logic.  I have a number of reservations about writing a custom
                        syntax engine:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Developers have to learn yet another domain specific language
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        It will be more limited than TypeScript
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        It would take time to write and get right
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        So, I've been searching for a way to run server side DAOs.  Based on what
                        I found all JavaScript sandboxes (apparently there are only a couple of them
                         out there) are both slow and can be compromized.  So after initial surge
                         of excitement I had to give up on an easy way sandbox JavaScript.  Yet
                         the idea of just running DAO logic to do server-side validation and server
                         side transactions was just too natural and convenient to give up on so I
                         finally determined that I would write an engine that would take parsed TypeScript,
                         serialized the AST to JSON and another engine that would take that AST and
                         re-generate JavaScript on the server side and do an "eval" call to re-construct
                         safe DAO logic on the server-side.  Of course this solution would 
                         (at least initially) be very limited in the syntax it would support and would
                         take a bunch of time to write and get right (just like the Firebase-like rule
                         engine, though probably a bit simpler).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then during a design review at my day-time contract Golang came up and I
                        was joyfully explaining how easy it is to learn and use.  A couple
                        of days later it hit me (thank God): Shouldn't I be able
                        to run the V8 engine isolates and should Go (being compiled to binary) be
                        runnable on mobile platforms, just like SqLite can be run in Cordova? Well,
                        it turns out that the hard work of making it possible has already been done:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/rogchap/v8go">GoLang V8 integration</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/golang/mobile">GoLang mobile integraion</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3">GoLang SqLite integration</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Having these 3 projects, along with a
                        <a href="https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp">fast GoLang web server</a> makes
                        writing a mobile app that uses <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/embed">V8 Isolates</a>
                        feasible for me (last time I used C was in a Scientific Computing course about 20
                        years ago).
                    </p>
                    <h2>JavaScript isolation in Browser</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the goals of AIRport is to provide a zero-install environment for user
                        trial.  This is the main reason why it's written it TypeScript (it can run
                        entirely in Web Browser, with either WebSql or SqlJs).  So it took a bit more
                        thinking that DAO isolation can be done in the browser with cross-domain 
                        iframes.  The main AIRport frame will contain one child frame for every
                        schema.  The child frame will run on a different domain than the main frame
                        and won't be able to call main framework code directly (only via postMessage).
                    </p>
                    <h2>The future is bright</h2>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, I'm very exited about where the DAO code will be headed with these fundings.
                        Essentially this means that the developers are now free to write whatever logic
                        the choose to see fit (and include whatever libraries they need for processing).
                        This make possible to write reusable server-side domain logic, which will allow
                        to reuse much more than the underlying schema and further simplifies writting
                        specialies add-on apps (while giving the original application creator more
                        assurances about their work being used properly).
