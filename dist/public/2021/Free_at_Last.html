                        <h2>Open sourcing, finally!</h2>
                        <p>4 month have passed since my last blog post and I didn't have any
                            time to devote to coding. Hence I'm open sourcing the projects
                            "as is" (with a bit of additional documentation). You can find
                            the projects at:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/beyond-decentralized">
                                    AIRport
                                </a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://github.com/votecube">
                                    Votecube
                                </a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note, I'm still holding on the the smaller family organizer project
                            from which it all started and will re-work it, once AIRport and Votecube
                            are completed.
                        </p>
                        <h2>No luck advertising</h2>
                        <p>I've also tried to promote AIRport via Facebook ads and so far am
                            having very little success in getting any likes (let alone any
                            sponsorship) so it looks like a long and lonely road for me in terms
                            of development.</p>
                        <h2>Crypto space seems interested</h2>
                        <p>I did get some interest on Koinos forum on Telegram, but they do not offer
                            any grants (being a self funded project. And I did apply for a grant at
                            Avalanche (they are technologically advanced enough to host AIR and do
                            offer
                            development grants) so will see how it goes.</p>
                        <h2>Government funding rejected - the reasons</h2>
                        <p>Also, I don't think I've mentioned it on the blog but last year I applied
                            for government funding and got rejected earlier this year. The 3 main
                            reasons
                            that were listed for rejection were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We don't understand it.</li>
                            <li>Is there any interest in this?</li>
                            <li>How can you make money with this?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>My reasoning about it</h3>
                        <p>I think that the, understanding part has to do with like-mindedness of the
                            people who are reading the proposal. Guys at Koinos seemed to get it
                            pretty quickly, but they are interested in more tooling for the developers
                            in their ecosystem (and I'm hoping that Avalanche guys are about in the
                            same
                            spot).</p>
                        <p>That sort of answers the general interest question as well. The pro's that
                            need it are interested, the developers in the ecosystem will certainly be
                            interested as well (since AIRport makes development much easier especially in
                            the
                            current crypto space), but the general developer public still doesn't get
                            it
                            (I've narrowed down my Facebook add to app and web developers only and so
                            far
                            am getting about 1 click per 120 showings).</p>
                        <p>The cool thing about pigging back on top of crypto projects is that these
                            guys have monetization (as well as security and data syncronization)
                            figured
                            out.</p>
