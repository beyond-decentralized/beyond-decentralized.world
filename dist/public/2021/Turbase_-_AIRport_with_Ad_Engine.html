                        <p>For a while now AIRport has been the brand for the AIR technology. And also for quite some
                            time
                            we've been dicussing building an adverisement engine on top of AIRport to generate revenue
                            that
                            can be shared with Apps and users. Now finally I've come up with a good enough of a brand
                            for the
                            actual App that will be installed on phones and other devices - Turbase.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The Advertisement Engine is a natural fit for Turbase. Since AIRport already stores user
                            data locally
                            on the device it makes sense to use that data for figuring out what Ads the user would like
                            to see.
                            One thing that is unique to Turbase is that it allows to do so without sharing user data
                            with any
                            central authority or the advertisers. They key is to provide a separation between the user
                            data with
                            a dedicated Ad engine, and the advertisement platform that works with Advertisers to gather
                            and serve
                            Ads.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Local Ad Engine</h2>
                        <p>
                            To make that work Turbase makes a determination what Ad should be shown locally on the
                            device. That
                            decision is based on the data that is being
                            requested by the Application and additional metadata that is provided by the App. Then
                            Turbase sends
                            a network request to an Advertisement Platform to request specific Ads. The Ad Platform will
                            expose
                            a query engine that Trubase apps can use to request specific adds based on a category-like
                            search. The
                            important thing is that this Ad lookup is done
                            without giving up any of the information about the user, or what data is being rendered on
                            the
                            page the user seeing or even what App their are using.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Revenue Sharing</h2>
                        <p>
                            The key part of Turbase Ad Engine is that it will share advertisement revenue between the
                            the adverisement
                            platform, the Turbase App, the App the user is using and the user themselves. A sharing
                            balance
                            will be achieved to keep all of the parties interested. Users will be interested in
                            providing
                            demographic data about themselves, which will stay on the device for the use by the local Ad
                            Engine.
                            Client Apps will be intested
                            in proving meaningful metadata about the content that is being shown to the user. And the
                            advertisement platform is interested in serving ads to devices without collecting user data
                            to cut costs and to generate good will.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Still to come</h2>
                        <p>
                            The development on the Ad Engine has not yet started - we'll need to secure additional
                            funding
                            to get it underway. The exact way we'll be doing has not yet been determined. At first it
                            will
                            start out as a set of simple queries to determine in a very primitive way what type of Ads
                            should
                            be shown. Subsequenly, as more people are involved in its development, we'll add statistical
                            modeling and AI.
