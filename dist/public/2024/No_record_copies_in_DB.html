                            With the current solution of copying records between Repositories there would still be
                            multiple records in the database for the same exact record - one per repository that has a
                            copy of that record. This is hard to maintain and comes with a performance penalty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The solution is very straightforward - only have one record in the database, even though
                            every repository has a copy in its Transaction log. This means that the current
                            REPOSITORY_LID field in an AirEntity now tracks the Local Id of the Repository to which this
                            record belongs. There is no need to track (in the database) the Repositories to which that
                            record is copied to, since there are already relationships that depend on that record.</p>
                        <p>
                            This approach greatly reduces the number of update operations that must be performed to just
                            the simple update operation that is already performed on an existing repository. An
                            additional check for local existence of the repository is needed to make sure not to run the
                            original Creation record. Instead if the Repository being loaded isn't present locally but
                            there are references to it the original create operation will instead be run as an Update
                            operation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To accomplish this, original Ids of all copied records will be stored in the
                            COPIED_RECORD_LEDGER table. During loading of repositories this table will be checked. If
                            any of the records in the loaded repository are present there they will be Updated instead
                            of being Created.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Update 2/18/2024
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            At the time of creation of record copies the general approach is to use the "save" operation
                            for saving copies of data (across repositories). Cross repository copies will be disallowed
                            in the lower level "insert" and "update" operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A new COPY operation type will be recorded in the transaction log. It will contain the save
                            timestamp of when the copy was made
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the time of loading copy data a check will be made against COPIED_RECORD_LEDGER to see if
                            the record is already present in the local database. If the Repository does not exist
                            locally a check will be made against the save timestamp to see if the newly loaded copy is
                            more recent than the existing one. If it is then the copy record will be replaced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a Repository is being loaded all of its loaded records will also be checked against
                            COPIED_RECORD_LEDGER existing records will be UPDATEd instead of being CREATEd (and the
                            entries in COPIED_RECORD_LEDGER will be deleted).
