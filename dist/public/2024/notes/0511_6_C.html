No earlier than the final reference implementation and support for NLNM company-grade
Organizations:

Tentatively scheduled well into the future: Move Framework to AssemblyScript (allowing for
transpilation to TypeScript for in browser debugging) and run in WASM.  Scheduled out quite
a bit farther: make framework transpile to C (and some libs I assume, school experience
only). This will greatly reduce the amount of resources required to run on personal devices
or in resource constrained environments. The Apps will be written in AssemblyScript too,
and SqLite will be linked in directly.
