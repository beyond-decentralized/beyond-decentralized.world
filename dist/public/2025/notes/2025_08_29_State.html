State
<br><br>
Without getting too much into the
tentatively-scheduled-to-start-in-17+-years-from-now-register-thinking
State management has been thought about before and now is the time to mention it.
<br><br>
While AIRport and its Apps are Object Oriented, every Service Object is by design
stateless.  In fact classes are realy only used for namespacing (and I guess
familiarity).  There were already plants to allow for pre-processed (like the
current depencency injection - another nice wrapper) state pointers in classes but
ultimately there will be 2 storage containers - Request and Session and any
state that appears to be in a framework maintained object will actually be in
one of those.  (Of course all objects will only be reachable from framework
maintained objects).
<br><br>
Request scope spans multiple applications and the framework and is short lived.
Session scope is compartmentalized in the App and is loaded as long as the
Application is loaded.
<br><br>
This of course allows for file grained memory management and will likely be
implemented several years from now, thinking of a future migration to WASM-bound
AssemblyScript and eventually beyond.
