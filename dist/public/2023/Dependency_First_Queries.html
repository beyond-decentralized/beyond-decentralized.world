                        <p>
                            This morning I finally arrived at the idea of how to efficiently and effectively ensure
                            repository Atomicity at query time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem of Atomic Repository queries has to do with the duality of state of Automic
                            Repositories.  This duality arises because Autonomous Repositories carry with them a local
                            version of all the records they depend on.  This means that when an AIRport database does
                            not have dependencies of a given Repository it can still provide full query results for that
                            Repository by first querying against the records that are local to that Repository and
                            subsequently checking other repository data for information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And it is exactly this thinking that got me stuck on the solution so far.  First checking
                            local copies and then progressively loading remote data is a complex solution.  It requires
                            constructing multiple versions of queries depending on what Repositories are loaded or are
                            missing.  This is exactly why as of right now AIRport repositories rely on availability of
                            Repository dependencies (progressively loading them and not checking local data records).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The initial solution to this complexity is to flip the problem description on its head. 
                            Instead of first checking local data, construct a join across Repository boundaries.  Then
                            check the result object tree against non-null constraints and see what is missing.  If there
                            is data that is missing then separate queries can be constructed against local data copies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This leaves the problem of WHERE clause statements against Repository dependencies.  In that
                            case a query will return a result that is missing records completely.  The solution for that
                            is to run a "fully local" query, detect missing records in the original query and stub them
                            in as necessary.  This solution replaces the non-null constraint check above, since cross
                            checking queries will both provide more accurate results and detect missing data at the same
                            time.  And the cost of doing so is fixed - AIRport has to always run 2 queries instead of
                            potentially any number of sub-queries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This works for both Observable and Promise queries since now instead of a single query run
                            every query performs two runs and a combined result set is returned. And, this solution also
                            covers the problem of having more missing data when immediate Repository dependencies are
                            loaded.  The identical "second query" process will detect and additional repositories that
                            must also be loaded to return the fully accurate query results.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Additional bonus - simple copy creation</h2>
                        <p>
                            An additional question came up on how to maintain the "copy records".  One approach is to
                            try to update the copies with the latest available data from the related repositories. 
                            However, this approach can get out of sync on different databases that have varying copies
                            of the related repositories (causing a potentially infinite loop of data conflict
                            resolutions).  On top of that this solution is not performant and requires additional
                            queries, persistence operations and network round trips and storage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The solution to this question now appears to be simple - just write the copy records once,
                            when the repository linking (or in most cases the linked data) is created.  This solves the
                            above problems in a very elegant way - if related repositories cannot be loaded you simply
                            see the original state of the linked data.
