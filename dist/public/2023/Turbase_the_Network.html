                            Storage of Repository data is pretty straight forward - every entry in its transaction log
                            can be a separate file, timestamped at the time of its creation (preferably the proven time
                            of persistence of the transaction log entry). But the retrieval of data is a lot more
                            complex. The original idea was to store each repository in a folder, with data being broken
                            out in chronological increments (days, months, years) into their own folders. Eventually the
                            idea of rolling up older transactions into single files was added, so that data for a given
                            year can be rolled up into a single file for faster retrieval (with a flat directory
                            structure containing year, month, day aggregates and recent individual log entries that call
                            all be retrieved at the same time after the directory contents are read).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AIRport runs primarily on the client device, with the transaction logs being retrieved and
                            composed into a working database right on user's phones or computers. This is needed to
                            ensure data privacy, with transaction logs being encrypted (and decrypted) on user devices.
                            This means that even in the optimal case of all data for a repository being created in a
                            single year (and thus a single file) 2 serially placed network calls are required to
                            retrieve the data. And in the ideal situation a single network call would be placed to
                            retrieve all of the data for a Repository.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, my latest thinking has been on how to accomplish that and so far I see no way of doing
                            so without introducing a dedicated network of database nodes that will aggregate the data.
                            This is further reinforced by my recent findings on how Filecoin and Arweave work - both
                            require CDN like networks on top of them to ensure fast data retrieval and persistence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that the original idea behind Turbase is now expanded into a fully blown network
                            of nodes that will provide persistence and retrieval of database transaction logs.
                            Internally these nodes can rely on Filecoin for data storage (primarily for backup purposes)
                            and optional permanent archival (into Arweave). But for timely data retrieval they will
                            likely have to maintain the transaction logs for as long as the user doesn't "file" them
                            into infrequently accessed long term storage (on Filecoin or Arweave).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The need for a full blown network of nodes is further reinforced by the fact that not all of
                            the data will belong to the users - quite a bit of it will be open data shared by
                            communities. Having Applications own that data isn't a good solution either, since they will
                            be materially motivated to restrict access to that data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is where the original idea behind Turbase re-enters but now in a new light. Instead of
                            simply being a web-site that hosts the code necessary for a client device to talk to storage
                            networks and run a database locally it now becomes a fully blown network of database nodes
                            on top of which Applications run.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arguments on how to make sure such a network remains independent and decentralized are yet
                            to be made but from a technological point of view this network is different from any
                            distributed database because the Relational Database engine and applications still run on
                            user devices. This means that for basic operation all that is needed is a (fast retrieval)
                            file server (for composite records) and an efficient NoSQL database (for recent records, yet
                            to be combined into the composite). Of course for community Apps data will likely also need
                            Full Text Search capability and also ability to make aggregate queries across repositories
                            so additional (FTS and RDBMS) functionality can be provided by these nodes as well.
                            Additional fast access storage may also be provided for the non-database data (images,
                            video's, etc.) that is referenced from the (not yet-archived) Repositories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And since the network will serve both private and community based storage needs it can be
                            scaled naturally within already existing community lines (metro areas, states/regions &
                            countries). Given that most of human activity is usually limited to these geographical areas
                            it only makes sense to partition the (non global) data in a corresponding way (but more on
                            that in a future post).
                        </p>

                        <h2>Update - Dec 7th, 2023</h2>
                        <p>
                            Node operator incentives should be structured around the fact that Turbase will host
                            community and private data, as well as provide open (but possibly paid) access to aggregated
                            relational data. Yes node operators should be compensated for their costs and should have a
                            profit margin but making profit shouldn't be the primary motivation. First and foremost
                            node operators will be in the business of providing a community service and should be
                            incentivized to prioritise hardware allocation (and not deallocate) based on the fact that
                            their community relies on them and not on the fact that Turbase provides the biggest profit
                            margin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This segues into the fact that Turbase data is meant to be partitioned into community run
                            clusters. This means that there should be a global cluster and a number of (tiered)
                            geographical community clusters. So a country can have its own cluster, as can a
                            state/region, a metro area, a county and a municipality. Turbase will also allow for topic
                            based communities to run their own clusters and for companies to also plugin into the
                            ecosystem by providing company operated clusters.
