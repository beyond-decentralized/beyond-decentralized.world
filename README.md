While Beyond Decentralized can run on IPFS (with Filecoin backing BD for a time) the intention is to tie it to [Data Independence Network](https://github.com/Data-Independence-Network/dataindependence.net) backend.  The technical specification of [Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No Seriouss Injury, CSCA simulation](https://github.com/Past-The-War-Earth/the-struggle-continues-anew.xyz) lead the [optimal design](https://github.com/Data-Independence-Network/trunk-core/blob/main/docs/History_Drivers_and_Overview.md) of DIN stack, making the needed by NLNM and Votecube real-time, low resource consumption backend possible.

## Plea for help

Since last year (2025) we've been considering moving to Russian Federation.  In the fall of last year the percieved inability to integrate our children's education and the lack of sufficient resources stalled our movement efforts.  After a brief consideration of other destinations despite the percieved inabilities I was driven to solve these problems.  Through this effort the need to develop DIN and NLNM simulation in the Eastern Hemisphere, more specifically in former Soviet Union and exactly in Russian Federation became apparent.  While BD is a universally applicable technology its adoption does not make sense without the nationally-hormoneous Regional Data Sovereignty proposition of DIN, which in turn can only be accomlished with the backing force and the driving engine of the NLNM simulation.  Given the natural overlap between our rooting in the Volga and Baikal regions I have now commited to making this move possible before September of 2026, when our son turns 10.  If I'm not able to present the option of this move to the family as realistic in time alloted, the development of DIN, NLNM simulation and with them the Beyond Decentralized stack will stall until our retirement age, over 20 years from now, if ever.

Hence, I'm asking for help.  Voluteers are always welcomed, but in over a decade of development and despite efforts to popularize the technology none have appeared.  It will be critical for me to maintain my employment, provided the regulatory environment allows me to stay with my employer in the Russian Federation (thus establishing a bridge between formely opposing sides of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine).  However, given that my sallary will likely be reduced, potentially significantly, we need additional material support.  If the [DIN](https://github.com/Data-Independence-Network/dataindependence.net) + BD vision and projects like NLNM simulation, Votecube and Sapoto (mentioned in DIN description) align with your values, please consider [supporting us](https://github.com/sponsors/beyond-decentralized). :)
